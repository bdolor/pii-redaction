Demonstrate the following functions: 

1.	conditional frequent distribution
2.	stemming
3.	tokenization
4.	language model
5.	POS tagging

You have some flexibility in showing the function in your own way, as long as each of your demonstrations clearly explains
•	the program you used (including the package, module, and class information). 
•	the data or corpora involved in the demonstration.
Include
•	a copy of the command lines and the sample sentences (when using sentences as the input) you used for the demonstration, and the program outputs you obtained. 
•	a brief explanation of the outputs and a short analysis of the issues (if any) such as ambiguity, correctness, and usefulness of the outputs.
