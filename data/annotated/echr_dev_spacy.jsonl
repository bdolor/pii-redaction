    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36110/97) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by four Turkish nationals, Mr Galip Yalman, Mr Bahattin Sar\u0131soy, Mr Osman \u00c7a\u011flayan and Mr Yusuf \u00c7amca (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 29 November 1996.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr S. Esmer, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.\n\nThe applicants alleged that their case, which commenced in 1989 and terminated in 1996, was not heard within a reasonable time as required by the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1).\n\nBy a decision of 15 May 2003, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nIn September 1980 the applicants were taken into police custody and were subsequently placed in detention on remand on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation. The Erzincan Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Erzincan Martial Law Court (s\u0131k\u0131y\u00f6netim askeri mahkemesi) charging the applicants under Article 146 of the Criminal Code with membership of an illegal organisation whose object was to undermine the constitutional order.\n\nOn various dates between 1982 and 1984 the applicants were released pending trial.\n\nOn 13 September 1988 the Erzincan Martial Law Court acquitted the applicants of the charges against them.\n\nOn various dates in March, April and June 1989 the applicants brought individual actions before the Sinop Assize Court against the Treasury, pursuant to Law no. 466. They requested compensation for their unjustified detention on remand.\n\nOn 20 October 1989 the court decided to join the applicants\u2019 cases.\n\nOn 15 December 1993 the Sinop Assize Court awarded non\u2011pecuniary compensation to the applicants. The applicants appealed, arguing that the amount of compensation awarded was not sufficient.\n\nOn 31 January 1995 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first instance court.\n\nOn 6 June 1995 the Sinop Assize Court increased the amount of non\u2011pecuniary compensation.\n\nOn 15 June 1995 the applicants again appealed.\n\nOn 30 May 1996 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal and upheld the judgment of the assize court.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in two applications (nos. 43185/98 and 43186/98) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two United Kingdom nationals, John Harding Price (introduced on 4 May 1998) and Mary Hazel Lowe (introduced on 12 August 1998).\n\nThe United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C.A. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicants alleged that the proceedings in which they were sued in respect of property in Florida were not dealt with within a reasonable time.\n\nThe applications were transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe applications were allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1).\n\nBy a decision of 3 September 2002 the Court declared the applications partly admissible, having in the meantime joined them on 28 November 2000.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1929 and 1923 respectively. The applicant in application no. 43185/98 (\u201cDr Price\u201d) is a consultant psychiatrist; the applicant in application no. 43186/98 (\u201cMrs Lowe\u201d) is a medical secretary. They live in Lincoln.\n\nThe applicants, together with Dr Price\u2019s wife, were sued by \u201cK\u201d, a former patient of Dr Price, in respect of property in Florida. The writ was issued on 12 February 1986. Before the action came to trial, the plaintiff was adjudicated bankrupt on 9 August 1989 and the trustee in bankruptcy continued the action.\n\nThe trial was set down to commence in the High Court in August 1994 but was postponed until the end of September 1994 because the judge was not available for the length of time needed for the hearing.\n\nOn the fourth day of trial, while K was being cross-examined, an adjournment was granted because K claimed to feel unwell. In the event, it emerged that no medical justification could be given for his continued non-attendance, but nonetheless he remained absent for the rest of the trial. Because of the delay caused by K\u2019s non-attendance, the trial could not be concluded in September 1994 and had to be adjourned until January 1995. Judgment was given on 27 April 1995.\n\nThe judge accepted the argument of the applicants and Mrs Price that it was necessary to disregard K\u2019s evidence because of his failure to remain for cross-examination. However, on the basis of the documentary evidence and that adduced by the applicants and Mrs Price, the judge found that the transfer of the Florida property should be set aside on the ground that the defendants had not been able to rebut the presumption of undue influence created by the discrepancy in the price they paid K for the property and its value at the time of the transfer, together with the doctor-patient relationship between Dr Price and K.\n\nThe formal record of the judge\u2019s order was not prepared by the parties until 26 October 1995. The applicants and Mrs Price applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal on 1 November 1995. The appeal bundles were lodged on 4 October 1996. On 15 January 1997 the appeal was listed for hearing, and it was heard on 16 and 17 April 1997, on which last date the Court of Appeal gave judgment dismissing the appeal.\n\nIn connection with the moneys paid by Dr Price for the property, the Court of Appeal confirmed the decision of the trial judge that the sum should be repaid, but that no interest should be paid on it. The trial judge had based his decision on the fact that Dr Price \u201chad had possession of the properties and receipt of the rents since the completion of the sale, subject only to the agreement to allow [K] to use number 212 in the early months\u201d. Lord Justice Nourse regarded this as a \u201crough and ready result\u201d, but one which would \u201creduce the opportunities for further dispute between the parties\u201d.\n\nOn 19 April 1997 the applicants and Mrs Price were refused leave by the Court of Appeal to appeal to the House of Lords. On 30 March 1998 the applicants and Mrs Price were refused leave to appeal by the House of Lords.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 42552/98) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by Turkish nationals, Mr Mehmet B\u00fclent Y\u0131lmaz and Mr \u015eahin Y\u0131lmaz (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 20 May 1998.\n\nThe applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr H.\u00c7. Akbulut, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 21 March 2002 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1975 and 1970 respectively.\n\nOn 19 and 20 August 1995 respectively the applicants were taken into custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorism Department of the Ayd\u0131n Security Directorate on suspicion of their membership to an illegal organisation, namely the DHKP/C.\n\nIn their police statements the applicants accepted the accusations against them.\n\nOn 22 August 1995 the applicants were brought before the investigating judge at the Ayd\u0131n Magistrate\u2019s Court, where they repeated the statements they had made to the police. The investigating judge ordered that they be placed in detention on remand.\n\nIn an indictment dated 6 September 1995, the public prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicants. He charged the first applicant with being member of an armed gang under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code and the second applicant with aiding and abetting an armed gang under Article 169 of the Criminal Code.\n\nDuring the hearings before the Izmir State Security Court, the applicants denied the statements they had made to the police and the investigating judge.\n\nOn 25 March 1997 the Izmir State Security Court, composed of two civilian judges and a military judge, convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced the first applicant to three years and nine months\u2019 imprisonment and the second applicant to twelve years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. Neither the applicants nor their lawyers were present in this last hearing.\n\nThe applicants appealed. On 12 November 1997 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal, upholding the Izmir State Security Court\u2019s reasoning and assessment of evidence. The decision, which was pronounced in the absence of the applicants and their lawyers, was deposited with the Registry of the Izmir State Security Court on 21 November 1997.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 5136/11) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Kamil Prus (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 6 December 2010.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr S. Kotu\u0142a, a lawyer practising in Lublin. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, a breach of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the imposition on him of the so-called \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime.\n\nOn 7 July 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1987 and is detained in Lublin.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 1 December 2005 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody. In 2006 he was convicted of three counts of battery and robbery and received prison sentences ranging from two to four years. On 28 November 2006 the Lublin Regional Court imposed a cumulative sentence for four criminal convictions.\n\nB. Imposition of the so-called \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime\n\nOn 5 November 2010 the Opole Lubelskie Prison Penitentiary Commission imposed on the applicant the so-called \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime. The commission held that the applicant had been the leader of or an active participant in a planned collective remonstrance in Opole Lubelskie Prison (Article 88a \u00a7 2 (2a) of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences), as the detainees refused to accept food provided by the prison authorities. The authorities learned that the detainees were planning another collective protest for 11 November 2010. The commission also considered that the applicant was particularly depraved.\n\nOn 18 January 2011 the Opole Lubelskie Prison Penitentiary Commission rejected an appeal lodged by the applicant and dismissed his request for leave to examine the appeal outside the statutory time-limit.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant was transferred to the Lublin Remand Centre.\n\nOn 3 February 2011 the Lublin Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission reviewed and upheld the decision to apply the regime to the applicant, considering that he posed a serious threat to the security of the detention centre. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 4 April 2011 the Lublin Regional Court dismissed the appeal. The court referred to the reasons given in the decision of 5 November 2010, holding that the decision had been lawful and justified.\n\nOn 3 March 2011 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Lublin Regional Inspectorate of Prisons. He complained that he was having difficulties in accessing educational activities in the Lublin Remand Centre. The authorities dismissed the complaint, holding that educational activities were not organised for dangerous prisoners.\n\nOn an unspecified date in 2011 the applicant notified the police of his allegedly unlawful classification as a \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d on 5 November 2010. He claimed that the Opole Lubelskie Prison authorities had exceeded their powers in imposing the regime on him. On 29 April 2011 the Opole Lubelskie District Prosecutor refused to open an investigation in the case, holding that no offence had been committed.\n\nOn 28 April 2011 the Lublin Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission revoked its decision to classify the applicant as a \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d. It considered that the applicant\u2019s behaviour had improved and that he no longer posed a threat to the security of the remand centre.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 57836/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Spencer James Mellors (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 12 January 2000.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr J. Carroll, a lawyer practising in Glasgow. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant alleged that his criminal proceedings exceeded a reasonable time contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nOn 19 June 2001, the Court rejected part of the application as inadmissible.\n\nOn 1 November 2001, the Court changed the composition of its sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section.\n\nBy a final decision of 30 January 2003, the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 3 in fine).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1964 and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in HM Prison Craiginches, Aberdeen.\n\nThe applicant was arrested on a charge of attempted murder arising out of a high speed car chase which occurred in the early hours of 29 October 1995. On 30 October 1995, he was arrested again, interviewed and cautioned in respect of a separate incident of rape and assault which also occurred during the early morning of 29 October 1995.\n\nOn 31 October 1995, the applicant appeared in court in respect of the various road traffic offences and the attempted murder of a police officer. On 7 November 1995, he was fully committed and remanded in custody on those charges (of which he was later acquitted).\n\nOn 30 November 1995, the applicant appeared before the Sheriff and was committed in respect of the rape charge.\n\nOn 24 June 1996, the trial began in the High Court. On 2 July 1996, the applicant was convicted, by a majority verdict, of all charges and sentenced to 9 years 9 months' imprisonment.\n\nOn 8 July 1996, the applicant lodged an intention to appeal with the High Court sitting as an appeal court. On 20 August 1996, a Note of Appeal was lodged.\n\nOn 26 September 1996, a single judge refused the appeal. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 31 October 1996, the Note of Appeal was allowed by three judges in restricted terms relating to the direction given by the trial judge on the special defence of alibi.\n\nOn 20 December 1996, the appeal was set down to be heard. According to the Government, it did not take place as the applicant refused to leave prison. The applicant stated that contrary to statutory authority the prison governor refused to allow him to leave the prison wearing civilian clothes instead of a prison uniform for the hearing. A further hearing was fixed for 22 May 1997. On that date, the Crown requested, and obtained, an adjournment as the Advocate Depute was engaged abroad.\n\nOn 19 November 1997, the appeal was set down to be heard. It was discontinued due to lack of court time and pressure of other business. It was noted that the appeal was complex and would last half a day.\n\nOn 13 and 14 January 1998, there was another appeal hearing. As the applicant's solicitor had become aware that the prosecution had never cited a witness, W. to appear at the trial, he had lodged and argued an additional ground of appeal on this point. Following argument, he sought to lodge further additional grounds of appeal. The appeal was continued to 13 February 1998 to enable him to do so.\n\nOn 13 February 1998, the High Court held that the failure to hear the evidence of W. resulted in unfairness and that further evidence should be heard. Lord Philip was designated as the judge to hear the evidence. On 28 May 1998, he fixed a date to take the evidence of W. On 20 August 1998, the hearing was adjourned as the applicant's counsel withdrew from acting on his behalf.\n\nOn 16 October 1998, W. gave evidence. In his note of 20 November 1998, Lord Philip gave his view of the credibility and reliability of W. The appeal was relisted for hearing on 8 January 1999 but the applicant's solicitors wrote to the court requesting that another date, possibly in the following week, be fixed due to the unavailability of counsel.\n\nOn 24 June 1999, the appeal was heard before the High Court.\n\nOn 22 July 1999, the judgment of the court was given by the Lord Justice General, Lord Rodger. It dismissed the applicant's appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36705/97) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Cypriot national, Mr Andreas Orphanides (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 9 June 1997.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr C. Clerides, a lawyer practising in Nicosia. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z.M. Necatigil.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus had prevented him from having access to his home and properties.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nBy a decision of 8 June 1999 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Government of Cyprus, which had exercised its right to intervene (Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 \u00a7 1 (b)).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Nicosia.\n\nThe applicant claimed that until July 1974 he used to live with his family in a house belonging to his parents in Lapithos, a village in the District of Kyrenia. In July 1974, as the Turkish army was advancing, the applicant and his family had been forced to leave Lapithos. Ever since, they have not been able to return to the applicant\u2019s parents\u2019 house.\n\nOn 20 April 1990 the applicant\u2019s parents donated half of their house to the applicant. They also donated to him half of three other houses, two shops and a number of plots of land and water installations in Lapithos. The remaining half of the properties mentioned above was transferred to the applicant\u2019s sister. The transfers at issue were recorded in the Land Registry of the Republic of Cyprus.\n\nThe applicant produced the relevant affirmations of ownership issued by the Republic of Cyprus. According to these documents, the applicant\u2019s properties could be described as follows: (a) plot no. 288/3, sheet/plan 11/14 E.1, plot of land \u2013 olive grove, area 2,282 sq. m; (b) plots nos. 511 and 513, sheet/plan 11/14E.2, plots of land, area: 3,862 sq. m and 3,405 sq. m respectively; (c) plots nos. 19, 20, 28 and 29, sheet/plan 11/15W.1, plots of land, area: 1,053 sq. m, 1,024 sq. m, 1,769 sq. m and 1,405 sq. m respectively; (d) plots nos. 98 and 128/1, sheet/plan 11/15W.2, lemon plantations, area: 5,219 sq. m and 1,469 sq. m respectively; (e) plot no. 296, sheet/plan 11/15W.2, lemon plantation with bore hole, area: 4,877 sq. m; (f) plots nos. 22, 22/1, 22/2, 22/3 and 22/4, sheet/plan 11/15W.2 and E.2, lemon plantation with two wells and one ground storey residence, area: 7,032 sq. m; (g) plot no. 42, sheet/plan 11/15W.2.E (no. 2), lemon plantation, area: 1,018 sq. m; (h) plot no. 104, sheet/plan 11/15W.2.E (no. 2), tank of an area of 37 sq. m with a freshwater spring; (i) plots nos. 60/1/2, 63/1 and 63/3, sheet/plan 11.23E.1,W (no. 1), lemon plantation (area: 2,358 sq. m) with a bore hole and one tank (area: 84 sq. m); on this property had been constructed: a ground storey residence of an area of 152.25 sq. m; two shops of an area of 56 sq. m; two semidetached ground storey residences (areas: 152.25 sq. m and 63 sq. m respectively); one residence of an area of 219.41 sq. m; (j) plots nos. 53, 773, 774, 775 and 776, sheet/plan 11/23W.2,E.1 and 11/23W1E (no. 2), right to use a freshwater spring.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus had prevented him from using and/or enjoying his properties.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36619/03) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Swedish national, Mr Lars Wassdahl (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 8 November 2003.\n\nThe Swedish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr M. Falk, Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 29 November 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the administrative proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Orsa.\n\nOn 28 May 1996 the Tax Authority (skattemyndigheten) of the County of Kopparberg sent a preliminary consideration (\u00f6verv\u00e4gande) to the applicant informing him that it was considering disallowing the deduction he had made for the interest he had paid on debts in the amount of 2,000,000 Swedish kronor (SEK), as well as his declared capital gains for the sale of stocks in the amount of SEK 775,000, that he had made in his tax return for 1995. Further, it was considering imposing tax surcharges (skattetill\u00e4gg) amounting to SEK 147,000 (approximately 15,800 euros [EUR]), i.e. 40% of the increased tax liability on the sum of SEK 1,225,000.\n\nThe preliminary consideration was based on an investigation of a company which had done business with a substantial number of private persons. As concerned the applicant, it appeared that he had borrowed SEK 40,000,000 from the company and commissioned it to buy stocks for the same amount on his behalf. The applicant then sold the stocks back to the company at a fixed date, upon which he had made a capital gain. At the same time, he repaid the loan together with interest to the company. As the capital gain corresponded to the interest, they were set off against each other. In the Tax Authority\u2019s view, the transactions had in reality never taken place and the applicant had simply received two statements of account and a promissory note in order to use them to obtain tax advantages.\n\nThe applicant was requested to submit any comments he might have to the Tax Authority by 22 July 1996, which he did. He claimed that the transactions had taken place and that his tax return should be approved.\n\nOn 27 September 1996 the Tax Authority decided to follow its preliminary consideration. With regard to the imposition of tax surcharges, it found that the applicant had submitted incorrect information about the purported transactions.\n\nOn 3 January 1997 the applicant appealed against the decision, disputing the Tax Authority\u2019s findings. He maintained that there were no grounds for disallowing the deductions or imposing tax surcharges on him.\n\nOn 30 April 1997 the Tax Authority made its obligatory re-assessment of its decision of 27 September 1996 but upheld it. It then forwarded the appeal to the County Administrative Court (l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten) of the County of Dalarna.\n\nOn 29 May 2000 the County Administrative Court rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal after having held an oral hearing. It agreed with the Tax Authority\u2019s conclusion that no transactions had in reality taken place between the applicant and the company, for which reason they could not be included in his tax return. Moreover, the court found that the applicant had submitted incorrect information to the Tax Authority and that there were no grounds on which to remit the tax surcharges.\n\nOn 30 June 2000 the applicant appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarr\u00e4tten) in Sundsvall, maintaining his claims. On 30 January 2002 he made further submissions to the court, stating inter alia that his rights under Article 6 of the Convention had been violated as he had not had access to the same material as the Tax Authority, and since the tax surcharges had been incorrectly imposed on him.\n\nBy judgment of 15 April 2002 the Administrative Court of Appeal upheld the lower court\u2019s judgment in full, without giving any new reasons of its own.\n\nOn 27 May 2002 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten), relying on the same grounds as before the lower courts and expanding them further.\n\nOn 11 September 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal.\n\nOn 25 November 2003 the applicant sued the Swedish State, through the Chancellor of Justice, before the District Court (tingsr\u00e4tten) in Stockholm. He sought SEK 6,850,000 (approximately EUR 736,000) in damages on the grounds that the Tax Authority and the administrative courts had not afforded him a fair procedure, having withheld certain information from him, and that the proceedings had been of excessive length. He invoked national legislation as well as the Convention and its case-law.\n\nThe State contested the suit, claiming that it had not caused the applicant any injury, either by fault or neglect, for which he could claim damages.\n\nIn a judgment of 21 December 2004, the District Court rejected the applicant\u2019s claims. As concerned the length of the proceedings, the court considered that the administrative courts\u2019 examination of his tax case had not taken so long as to incur the State\u2019s liability for damages.\n\nOn 27 December 2004 the applicant appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal (hovr\u00e4tten), maintaining his claims.\n\nOn 2 November 2005 the Court of Appeal upheld the lower court\u2019s judgment in full. With regard to the complaint about the length of the proceedings, the court, without giving any reasons, found that the tax proceedings could not be considered to have been of excessive duration.\n\nOn 12 October 2005 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court (H\u00f6gsta domstolen) where the case is still pending, awaiting a decision on leave to appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 19365/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Robert Edward Hill (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 11 March 2002.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr S. Creighton, a solicitor practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Willmott of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant, serving a sentence of mandatory life imprisonment, alleged that the Parole Board did not provide the guarantees and procedures required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 when examining whether he should be released and that he had no enforceable right to compensation for any breach of his rights as required by Article 5 \u00a7 5.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 23 September 2003, the Court declared the remainder of application admissible.\n\nThe applicant filed observations on just satisfaction and the Government replied (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1959 and is serving a sentence of life imprisonment in HM Prison Doncaster.\n\nThe applicant was convicted in or around 1981 for the murder of an acquaintance. He was sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment, and his tariff (the minimum period of imprisonment required to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence) was set at 12 years.\n\nAt the time of the applicant's latest Parole Board review in 2001, he was detained in HM Prison Wymott as a \u201cCategory C\u201d prisoner (prisoners being given a security category classification ranging from Category A (highest risk) to Category D (suitable for open conditions)). The Parole Board recommended that the applicant should be transferred to open conditions, and that his detention should be reviewed after two years. By letter dated 6 July 2001 the Secretary of State informed the Prison Service that he did not accept the Parole Board's recommendation for transfer to open conditions, and that the next review should begin after 12 months. In the letter to the applicant which accompanied the decision it was stated that: \u201c... [t]he Secretary of State attaches particular weight to the psychologist's report, it has highlighted in some detail, the need for further exploration of your insight into, and responsibility for, the index offence and the apparent lack of empathy towards the victim.\u201d\n\nIn June 2001 the applicant was transferred to HM Prison Manchester. He claimed that he did not receive notification of the parole decision until sometime after 13 September 2001. The Government stated that a copy of the decision letter was sent to the applicant on 6 July 2001 and a copy to the solicitors then acting for the applicant on 7 August 2001. When the applicant changed his solicitors in September 2001, the authorities sent a copy of the decision to the new solicitors.\n\nThe applicant stated that he wanted to seek judicial review of the decision, but was unable to find a solicitor who was prepared to act on his behalf. His then solicitors gave advice that judicial review stood little prospect of success as the reports recommending a move to open conditions had been slightly ambiguous, there were a number of very unfavourable reports and the Secretary of State had given extensive reasons for rejecting the recommended move.\n\nThe applicant's first Parole Board oral hearing under new arrangements was scheduled for November 2003. At the applicant's request, it was deferred until May 2004 to allow the applicant time to complete certain courses identified in the reports for the Parole Board review.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 38629/97) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Swedish national, Rolf Lundevall (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 28 February 1997.\n\nThe applicant was until 31 May 2000 represented by Mr G. Antal and thereafter by Mr U. Jacobson, both lawyers practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Jagander, Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his rights under Article 6 of the Convention had been violated on account of the lack of an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal in proceedings concerning social security benefits.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 4 May 2000 the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nOn 6 October 1986 the applicant, who was born in 1919, applied for disability benefits under the Social Insurance Act (Lagen om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring, 1962:381; hereinafter \u201cthe 1962 Act\u201d). He claimed that he was in need of assistance and had additional costs due to a speech impediment caused by a laryngectomy operation in 1979.\n\nBy a decision of 24 April 1987 the Social Insurance Office (f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan; hereinafter \u201cthe Office\u201d) of the County of V\u00e4stmanland rejected the application, finding that the applicant\u2019s needs or costs were not such as to make him eligible for disability benefits.\n\nOn 27 December 1990 the applicant requested the Office to review its decision under chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act. He claimed that he had failed to fully state his need of assistance and his additional costs in the original application. On 27 April 1991 he asked the Office, alternatively, to consider his request as a new application and to grant him benefits as from November 1988.\n\nOn 12 July 1991 the Office found that there was no basis for a review of its earlier decision. Further, in regard to the applicant\u2019s alternative claim, the Office noted that the applicant had reached the age of 65 in 1984 and that information relating to the time that followed could not be taken into account under the relevant rules. Consequently, the applicant\u2019s alternative claim was rejected.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court (l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten) of the County of V\u00e4stmanland. On 13 November 1992 the court gave judgment in his favour. It considered that the Office\u2019s first decision had been based on insufficient information and that the Office should therefore have reviewed that decision at the applicant\u2019s request. It noted that, according to the two medical certificates in the case, the applicant had considerable additional costs due to his handicap. Consequently, he was entitled to disability benefits as long as his need of assistance and his additional costs, taken together, attained the level required under the 1962 Act. Accepting the information submitted by the applicant in this regard, the court found that that level had been attained and granted him a disability allowance as from July 1986. The court did not hold an oral hearing nor, apparently, did the applicant request one.\n\nThe National Social Insurance Board (Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket; hereinafter \u201cthe Board\u201d) appealed against the County Administrative Court\u2019s judgment to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarr\u00e4tten) in Stockholm, requesting that the Office\u2019s decision of 12 July 1991 be confirmed. The Board claimed that the information in the case showed that, before the age of 65, the applicant had not suffered a functional impairment to such an extent that his need of assistance and extra expenses on account thereof had made him eligible for a disability allowance. Thus, the Office\u2019s first decision could not be considered to have been incorrect due to it being based on incorrect or incomplete material. Consequently, there were no grounds for a review under the 1962 Act. The Board further requested the appellate court to stay the enforcement of the appealed judgment. The latter request was granted by a decision of 30 December 1992.\n\nThe applicant made submissions in response to the Board\u2019s appeal. On 25 February 1993 he requested the Administrative Court of Appeal to hold an oral hearing in the case during which the person in charge of the case at the Office should give evidence relating to the meaning of its decision and the information on which it had been based. The applicant also asked the court to obtain the opinion of a medical expert.\n\nOn 12 November 1993 the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected both requests. In regard to the request for an oral hearing, the court, after having restated section 9 of the Administrative Court Procedure Act (F\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen, 1971:291; hereinafter \u201cthe 1971 Act\u201d; see further paragraph 23 below), gave the following reasons: \u201cHaving regard to the subject-matter at issue and the information that has come to hand in the case, [the court] finds that an oral hearing is unnecessary and rejects the request to that effect. [The applicant] is invited to state the further circumstances he wishes to invoke and submit his final written observations in the case within two weeks after having been notified of this decision. The case can be determined notwithstanding a failure to submit such written observations.\u201d\n\nThe applicant and the Board made further submissions. The applicant maintained that the Board had failed to adequately explain the reasons for its appeal and posed several questions to the Board. He requested that the court order the Board to clarify its position in the case. The court did not do so, however. The applicant\u2019s submissions were, however, forwarded to the Board which replied that it maintained its position in the case. On account of the court\u2019s refusal to order the Board to clarify its position and to hold a hearing, the applicant called into question the impartiality of the proceedings. By letters of 16 September 1994 and 10 January 1995 he reiterated his request for an oral hearing, stating that a hearing would give him the opportunity to ask questions to the Board and to present judgments in similar cases in support of his application for disability benefits. Furthermore, in assessing his condition, the court would benefit from having met him in person.\n\nOn 1 November 1995 the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant\u2019s renewed requests for an oral hearing and gave judgment in favour of the Board. Thus, by 3 votes to 2, it quashed the County Administrative Court\u2019s judgment and confirmed the Office\u2019s decision of 12 July 1991. Without giving any further reasons, it considered that there had been no basis for a review of the Office\u2019s first decision. The dissenting judges considered that the applicant was entitled to the disability allowance granted to him by the County Administrative Court and that, for this reason, there were exceptional reasons to change the Office\u2019s decision.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten). He requested that the case be referred back to the Administrative Court of Appeal for re-examination or, alternatively, that the Supreme Administrative Court confirm the County Administrative Court\u2019s judgment. He complained about the lack of an oral hearing in the Administrative Court of Appeal and also requested the Supreme Administrative Court to hold an oral hearing. On 24 February 1997 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.\n\nOn 9 October 1996 the applicant made a renewed request for a disability allowance. By a decision of 12 December 1996 the Office found that he had special needs and costs due to his handicap which made him eligible for disability benefits under the 1962 Act. As an allowance could be given retroactively only for the two years preceding the application, the applicant was granted an allowance as from October 1994.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court on 12 July 1993 by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) and on 3 August 1993 by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (\u201cthe Government\u201c), within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 18711/91) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 4 April 1991 by a British citizen, Mr Anthony Boner. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government\u2019s application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). The object of the request and the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c).\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\n\nOn 23 August 1993, the President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice this case and the case of Maxwell v. the United Kingdom (no. 31/1993/426/505) should be heard by the same Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6). The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 25 August 1993, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr R. Macdonald, Mr J. De Meyer, Mrs E. Palm, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr F. Bigi, Mr A.B. Baka and Mr J. Makarczyk (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant\u2019s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant\u2019s memorial on 31 December 1993 and the Government\u2019s memorial on 10 January 1994. On 5 April 1994 the Government submitted their written reply to the applicant\u2019s claims for just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention. On 15 April 1994 the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would not submit written observations in reply.\n\nIn accordance with the President\u2019s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 18 April 1994. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr I. Christie, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, QC, Lord Advocate, Mr R. Reed, Counsel, Mr I. Jamieson, Mr A. Dickson, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission Mr L. Loucaides, Delegate;\n\nfor the applicant Ms R. Rae, QC, Counsel, Ms A.M. Chisholm, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Loucaides, Lord Rodger and Ms Rae as well as replies to its questions.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, Mr Anthony Boner, is a British citizen born in 1960. He lives in Glasgow, Scotland. On 14 December 1989 three masked men, armed with a shotgun and a knife, carried out a robbery at a post office in Glen Village, Falkirk, Scotland, in the course of which they assaulted three post-office employees. They also caused damage to a motor car. Following investigations, Mr Boner and two other men were arrested and remanded in custody. The applicant was indicted on a charge of assault and armed robbery, a charge of wilful damage and three charges relating to firearms. Between 29 March and 10 April 1990 he stood trial in the High Court of Justiciary sitting in Edinburgh.\n\nThe applicant received legal aid for the preparation of his defence and for his representation by counsel at the trial.\n\nDuring the trial a prosecution witness, Mrs G., entered the courtroom prior to giving evidence and spoke to one of the applicant\u2019s co-accused, against whom charges had been dropped. When Mrs G. was called to give evidence, the applicant\u2019s counsel objected on the basis of her earlier presence in court. The trial judge adjourned the case and instructed prosecuting counsel to make further inquiries into the matter so that it could be determined whether Mrs G.\u2019s attendance was due to any negligence or failure on the part of the Crown. Prosecuting counsel informed the judge that inquiries had revealed no fault on the part of anyone for whom the Crown bore responsibility. This was not disputed by the applicant\u2019s counsel, who, moreover, was unable to give any indication as to how Mrs G.\u2019s evidence could be affected by her earlier presence in court. The trial judge accordingly took the view that no injustice would be done by Mrs G.\u2019s examination. Finding that the relevant legal conditions were satisfied (see paragraph 17 below), he therefore exercised his discretion and permitted her to give evidence. Subsequently, counsel for the applicant had the opportunity to cross-examine Mrs G. on the matter of her attendance in court. In her evidence, Mrs G. stated that the applicant had been at her home the evening before the robbery and had spoken of robbing the post office. The following morning he had left the house and returned later with a bag, in a state of nervousness. Other evidence against the applicant included the fact that a shotgun and various items stolen from the post office were found on the applicant\u2019s premises. In addition, a different witness identified Mr Boner as being one of the robbers and Mrs G.\u2019s statement was supported by her 9-year-old daughter.\n\nThe jury found the applicant guilty on all the charges. Taking account of his numerous previous convictions, the judge sentenced him to eight years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nOn 17 April 1990 the applicant, through his solicitor, lodged an intimation of intention to appeal against conviction.\n\nMr Boner instructed new solicitors, who asked a different counsel to advise on the prospects of an appeal and to draft a note of appeal. In his opinion dated 10 June 1990 counsel stated his view that the only possible ground of appeal related to the \u201cadmissibility of the evidence of Mrs G.\u201c and to the question \u201cthat the trial judge erred in exercising discretion in allowing her to be present\u201c. However, he conceded that he had not been provided with sufficient information to be able properly to base an opinion or to frame grounds of appeal. Notwithstanding this acknowledgement he did draft a note of appeal which contained six grounds, the first two of which concerned the trial judge\u2019s decision to admit the witness. This note of appeal was filed by the applicant\u2019s solicitors on 13 June 1990.\n\nUp to this point all the work had been covered by the legal aid granted for the trial. An application to extend legal aid to the appeal proceedings had been submitted in May 1990. On 25 July 1990 the Scottish Legal Aid Board (\u201cthe Board\u201c) asked the applicant to provide an opinion from counsel on the prospects of success. The earlier opinion dated 10 June 1990 was accordingly forwarded to the Board, together with a supplementary opinion from the same counsel dated 6 September 1990. In this latter opinion counsel reiterated the view that the appeal rested on the question whether Mrs G.\u2019s evidence was admissible. However, he again stated that he had not been provided with sufficient material on which to assess the merits of the appeal. \u201cI regret meantime I am unable to answer the fundamental question in this case\u201c, he concluded.\n\nOn 27 September 1990 the applicant\u2019s solicitors informed the Board by telephone that counsel had finally decided that he could not support the application for legal aid or the appeal; that they were of the same view; and that, consequently, they could no longer act for the applicant. The terms of that telephone call were confirmed in a letter dated 2 November 1990 from the solicitors to the Board.\n\nOn 14 November 1990 the Scottish Legal Aid Board notified Mr Boner\u2019s solicitors that his application for legal aid had been refused as the Board was not satisfied, as it was required to be under the relevant legislation (see paragraph 26 below), that he had substantial grounds for taking an appeal and that it was reasonable that he should receive legal aid. In a letter of 11 December 1990 to the applicant the Board added that it could not see any merit in the appeal. Despite the advice of his solicitors and counsel, Mr Boner decided to proceed with the appeal.\n\nThe applicant, who had no legal knowledge and had no assistance with his submissions, presented his own case on 24 January 1991 before the High Court of Justiciary, sitting in Edinburgh and acting as an appellate court. The Crown was represented by counsel. There is no indication in the record that the court required counsel for the Crown to address it.\n\nThe appeal court considered the first two grounds of appeal relating to Mrs G. and held that these were ill-founded and that the trial judge had approached the matter properly. As the applicant did not address the court on the remaining grounds of appeal, these were not considered by the court. It did however examine other points raised by the applicant, but reached \u201cthe clear conclusion that there was no miscarriage of justice in the case\u201c. The appeal against conviction was unanimously dismissed.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31881/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Bedran Gencer (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 22 July 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr H. Cangir, a lawyer practising in Mardin. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nThe applicant alleged that, as a result of unfair decisions given by the domestic courts, he had been deprived of his land which was the main source of income for his family. He relied on Articles 6, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nOn 15 January 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1952 and lives in \u015eanl\u0131urfa.\n\nOn 22 November 1984 Law no. 3083 came into force. Article 5 of this law provided the possibility of leasing State land to farmers who were in need and who fulfilled certain eligibility criteria (\u201cright holders\u201d). In particular, Article 24 \u00a7 1 of Law no. 3083 provided that those who had been convicted of certain offences were not entitled to benefit from this law (see paragraph 16 below).\n\nFollowing the promulgation of Law no. 3083, the applicant applied to the Commission which determined the eligibility of farmers to be right holders and requested to be provided with land in Ceylanp\u0131nar in the south-east of Turkey.\n\nOn 1 March 1999 the applicant was identified as a right holder and leased land from the Directorate General for Agricultural Reform (Tar\u0131m Reformu Genel M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc) (\u201cthe Directorate General\u201d) for an indefinite period on payment of a rent. The applicant earned his living by cultivating this land.\n\nOn 11 May 2000, after conducting a \u201csecurity investigation\u201d, the Directorate General annulled the right holder status of the applicant.\n\nOn 31 May 2000 the applicant brought an action in the Gaziantep Administrative Court requesting the stay of execution and reversal of the Directorate General\u2019s decision.\n\nOn 8 June 2000 the Gaziantep Administrative Court decided to request the defendant administration to indicate the reasons which grounded its decision to annul the right holder status of the applicant. The court invited the defendant administration to submit their response and relevant documents within thirty days.\n\nOn 2 August 2000 the Gaziantep Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for a stay of execution of the decision, holding that necessary conditions were not met.\n\nOn an unspecified date, the Directorate General refused to submit the information or documents requested by the Gaziantep Administrative Court. In this respect, the Directorate General relied on Article 20 \u00a7 3 of the Law on Administrative Procedure which provides that the Prime Minister or other Government Minister may refrain from submitting information or documents to an administrative court if the information or documents in question pertain to the security or vital interests of the State.\n\nOn 7 December 2000 the Gaziantep Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s case. The court held that the impugned decision of 11 May 2000 and the refusal of the Directorate General to submit the relevant information and documents had been in accordance with the domestic legislation. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 15 April 2002 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. This decision was served on the applicant on 5 July 2002.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 26390/95) against the Kingdom of Norway lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Norwegian-Swiss national, Mr Gunnar Beck (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 28 January 1995.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Bj\u00f8rn Stordrange, a lawyer practising in Oslo (Norway). The Norwegian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Frode Elgesem, Attorney, Attorney-General\u2019s Office (Civil Matters).\n\nThe applicant alleged that certain criminal proceedings against him in relation to fraud charges had exceeded a reasonable time, in violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court.\n\nBy a decision of 16 November 1999 the Chamber declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 2 in fine), decided the case on the basis of the case-file as it stood.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nIn the autumn of 1985 the applicant, together with three associates, started a business involving lactic cultures, purportedly for use in the cosmetic industry. It consisted of two limited liability companies, founded respectively in August and December 1985 and named Cosmesin Laboratorieprodukter A/S (\u201cCosmesin\u201d) and Geneve A/S (\u201cGeneve\u201d). According to the Norwegian courts\u2019 findings in the proceedings referred to below, the business was a fraudulent pyramid scheme by which Cosmesin purchased from a producer in Denmark freeze-dried concentrates of lactic acid bacteria at 100 Norwegian kroner (NOK) per bag (containing 0.5 grams), resold them to Geneve at NOK 240 per bag, which again sold them at the price of NOK 330 per bag to cultivators whom it had recruited, and after 15 weeks bought the cultivated products back at the price of NOK 625. The number of producers increased from 4 at the end of 1985 to 3,205 at the end of January 1987. Payments were made to a company in London. No goods containing the cultivated substances were ever marketed or produced. As of November 1986, the companies stopped bookkeeping.\n\nOn 27 January 1987 the Consumer Ombudsman (Forbrukerombudet) filed a complaint with the Director General of Public Prosecutions (Riksadvokaten) against Geneve and Cosmesin for defrauding several thousand persons who had invested in products from Geneve. The companies went into bankruptcy in February 1987. Between February and April 1987 the police received 335 complaints from cultivators in various parts of Norway. Further complaints were made in January 1988 and January 1989 respectively by a major bank and the tax authorities.\n\nOn 29 January 1987 the police interviewed the applicant as a witness, because of his role in the companies. On 30 January 1987 the police carried out searches of premises and confiscations. Such measures, including interviews of the persons involved, continued in February. On 20 February 1987 the applicant was arrested but then released on certain conditions. He then moved to Switzerland and, by a letter of 4 December 1987, his lawyer informed the police of his Swiss address and his preparedness to go to Oslo to meet police investigators if necessary. Throughout 1987 investigations were conducted in Denmark, Sweden and England concerning the companies\u2019 business connections and investments. In April 1989 the police held meetings with Swedish and English police authorities. In October 1991 and April 1992 the police interviewed 12 cultivators. On 29 February 1988 the Probate Court (skifteretten) received the final report from the administrators of the estates of Cosmesin and Geneve. On 26 January 1989, the police received the tax authorities\u2019 report on the tax and value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) offences.\n\nAfter the initial interviews mentioned above, one of the two leading figures in the criminal activity concerned, Mr D.R., disappeared. In November 1987 a search for him with an arrest warrant was made via Interpol. On 7 November 1990 he was arrested by the Spanish police. The Norwegian authorities requested his extradition on 23 November 1990. On 8 July 1991 he was released from custody in Spain, subject to a duty to report to the police. In early February 1992 he was extradited to Norway.\n\nFollowing the issuing of indictments in August 1989, the case was submitted to the Oslo City Court on 4 September 1991.\n\nOn 19 February 1992 the City Court fixed 5 October 1992 for opening the trial hearing, rather than the earlier date of 22 April 1992, to which objection had been made by defence counsel, whilst accepted by the prosecution.\n\nIn the final indictments issued on 17 March 1992, the applicant was charged with the offences of serious fraud in relation to amounts totalling approximately NOK 25,000,000 (Articles 270 and 271 of the Penal Code), unlawfully drawing up cheques \u2013 in amounts totalling almost NOK 4,500,000 \u2013 on behalf of an insolvent company (Articles 285 and 288 of the Penal Code), and having disregarded statutory obligations relating to bookkeeping and the provision of information to the authorities relevant to VAT payments, with the resultant evasion of approximately NOK 3,500,000 (Article 286 of the Penal Code and section 72 of the VAT Act 1969 \u2013 merverdiavgiftsloven). After holding a hearing over 20 days in October and November 1992, the City Court, by a judgment of 19 November 1992, convicted the applicant of all but the VAT charges, and sentenced him to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment. As regards sentencing, the City Court noted from the outset that the offences for which the applicant was convicted were punishable by up to 9 years\u2019 imprisonment. It further stated that general considerations of crime prevention suggested that economic offences of the kind at issue warranted a severe penalty. As it appears from its reasoning, the City Court found the defendants\u2019 conduct particularly reprehensible and emphasised that the suffering which they had caused to innocent cultivators must be viewed as an aggravating factor in sentencing. The City Court then went on to consider the question of mitigation, having regard to the following three factors: \u201cWith the exception of D.R., the accused were of a young age at the time of the commission of the proscribed conduct. ... There were thus important years for settling down which elapsed between the criminal acts and judgment in the case. Furthermore, the Court attaches some weight, albeit not a great deal, to the fact that the offences were committed at a time when banks were somewhat uncritical about giving loans. ... In the court\u2019s view, had greater caution been displayed, the pyramid scheme would have been revealed earlier. Finally the court attaches weight, to a not insignificant degree, to the fact that a long time has elapsed since the acts were committed. The prosecution transmitted the case to the Oslo City Court in December 1991 and final investigations concerning one aspect of the case as important as the value of the cultivators and their possible use went on as late as the first semester of 1992. Although it is correct that D.R. stayed abroad over long periods, the court could not see how this could justify the delays in the investigations. It is understood that the delays in the investigation were caused by a change of investigators in the case. Notwithstanding that weight must be given to the long time that has elapsed since the acts were committed, the court finds that the sentencing must be severe.\u201d Two other co-defendants, including Mr D.R., who were considered to have played a more prominent role in the proscribed activity, were sentenced to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nOn 28 December 1992 the applicant sought to appeal to the Supreme Court, alleging a procedural error in the first instance proceedings and requesting a new trial. On 29 April 1993 the Appeals Selection Committee of the Supreme Court (H\u00f8yesteretts kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg) admitted the appeal in as far as it concerned the procedural matter. In the proceedings before the Supreme Court the applicant in addition asked for a reduction in sentence. After taking evidence on 14 December 1993 and holding a hearing on 6 September 1994, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal on 13 September 1994. As regards sentencing, it recalled that the City Court had taken into consideration as a mitigating circumstance the long time which had elapsed since the incriminated conduct. The Supreme Court held that, although more time had elapsed since the City Court\u2019s judgment, it saw no reason for reducing the sentence.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 19582/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ali \u00c7imen (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 8 December 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. \u0130\u015feri, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 13 March 2007 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning the lack of legal assistance to the applicant during his police custody and the non-communication of the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Izmir.\n\nOn 17 April 2000 the applicant was taken into custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorist Branch of the Izmir Security Directorate on suspicion of his involvement in the activities of an illegal armed organisation.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant was interrogated at the Anti-Terrorist branch in the absence of a lawyer. According to a form explaining arrested persons\u2019 rights which the applicant had signed, he had been reminded of the charges against him and of his right to remain silent. In his statement, the applicant admitted to his involvement in the illegal armed organisation.\n\nOn 20 April 2000 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and subsequently the investigating judge at the Izmir State Security Court. Before the public prosecutor and the judge, again in the absence of a lawyer, the applicant admitted that he had participated in certain activities of the illegal armed organisation.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested to visit him; however this request was rejected by the Public Prosecutor.\n\nOn 2 May 2000 the Public Prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court filed a bill of indictment with that court, accusing the applicant of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation. He requested that the applicant be sentenced and convicted under Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713).\n\nOn 5 December 2000 the Izmir State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to three years and nine months\u2019 imprisonment. In its decision, the court attached particular importance to the applicant\u2019s statements to the investigating judge.\n\nOn 25 December 2000 the applicant appealed. On an unspecified date, the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion. This opinion was not served on the applicant or his representative. On 11 June 2001, the Court of Cassation, upholding the reasoning and assessment of the Izmir State Security Court, dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 60286/09) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Nigerian national, Mr Moshood Abiola Balogun (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 13 November 2009.\n\nThe applicant was represented by OA Solicitors, a firm of lawyers practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms L. Dauban of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant alleged that his deportation to Nigeria would breach Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn 18 November 2009, the Acting President of the Fourth Section decided to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, indicating to the Government that it was in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicant should not be expelled to Nigeria pending the Court\u2019s decision. On 9 March 2010 the Vice-President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1986, claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom at the age of three years old. However, there is no official record of his presence until 1994, when he was eight years old. He first came to the notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department on 21 December 1994, when the family court sought clarification of the applicant\u2019s immigration status, while considering an application for a residence order in respect of the applicant by his aunt.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s aunt made an application for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom, on the basis of her long stay, and with the applicant listed as her dependant, on 24 January 2003. While this application was under consideration, a further application for indefinite leave was made on behalf of the applicant by Southwark Social Services. This application stated that the applicant had been thrown out by his aunt on 12 January 2002 and placed in foster care. It also mentioned that the applicant claimed to have been the victim of beatings by his aunt and her boyfriend since the age of three. Indefinite leave to remain was granted to the applicant, outside the immigration rules, on 1 December 2003. The applicant lived in foster care from 2002 until he was eighteen, when he began to live alone in council accommodation.\n\nThe applicant was convicted on 21 February 2007, at the age of twenty, of two counts of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply. He pleaded guilty on the basis that he had been coerced into letting his premises be used for the preparation and sale of drugs by a group of people whom he feared because of a previous attack in 2005, in which the applicant had been shot. He was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment, and on 18 October 2007 was notified of the Secretary of State\u2019s intention to deport him. The Secretary of State found that there was no evidence that the applicant had been present in the United Kingdom since the age of three. His aunt had stated that he had been left with her by his mother at the age of five, and the first official record of his presence was when he was eight years old. Even allowing for his long stay in the United Kingdom, only four years had been with valid leave. It was believed that he was in contact with his mother, who remained in Nigeria, and that as he had lived alone since attaining the age of majority, the applicant was evidently independent and capable of adapting to new circumstances. It was not accepted that he had family life in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision to deport him and his appeal was dismissed by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal on 13 March 2008. The Tribunal noted the applicant\u2019s previous criminal record: he had been convicted of possession of Class A and Class B drugs in February 2004; handling stolen goods in April 2004; and possession of Class C drugs in June 2005.\n\nThe Tribunal also noted his claim to be in a relationship of some years\u2019 duration, but observed that he had never mentioned his girlfriend in previous applications to the Home Office, and that he and his girlfriend had given mutually inconsistent evidence at the hearing. It was not therefore accepted that he was in a serious or permanent relationship. He had no contact with the aunt with whom he had previously lived, but had another aunt in the United Kingdom whom he claimed was a surrogate mother to him. However, the Tribunal found that he could not be as close to this aunt as he claimed, given that she had not taken him in when he had been thrown out, and that it was clear from her evidence at the hearing that she had been unaware of his criminal conviction. The applicant\u2019s relationship with his half-brother in the United Kingdom was found to have been similarly exaggerated. The Tribunal concluded that the applicant did not have any protected family life in the United Kingdom. With regard to his private life, while it was accepted that he had been in the country since a young age and had been educated there, as well as gaining some work experience, it was not considered that these ties were sufficiently strong to render his deportation an interference with his private life. It appeared that his mother still lived in Nigeria and, even if contact had been lost, as claimed by the applicant, there was no reason why it could not be re-established. Whilst the applicant would have practical difficulties in relocating to Nigeria, he could re-establish his private life there. The Tribunal took into account the case of \u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, ECHR 2006\u2011XII, in finding that, on balance, and having due regard to the public interest, the applicant\u2019s deportation was proportionate.\n\nA deportation order against the applicant was signed on 14 October 2008. The applicant made an application to have the order revoked on human rights grounds, which was rejected by the Secretary of State on 3 June 2009 on the basis that all matters raised by the applicant had previously been considered by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. An application for judicial review of this decision was refused on 30 October 2009. The High Court, in refusing the application, stated that the applicant had no family life in the United Kingdom, and that the interference with his private life was proportionate. The applicant did not renew his application for judicial review.\n\nThe applicant was taken into immigration detention on 10 November 2009 and directions for his deportation to Nigeria were set on 12 November 2009 for 19 November 2009. On 13 November 2009 the applicant sought interim measures from this Court under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court to prevent his deportation. He submitted with his application a report from a specialist psychiatric registrar dated 14 September 2009, which stated that the applicant had attempted suicide on 13 August 2009, after being notified of the refusal of his human rights application by the Secretary of State. He had then been held as an in-patient until 7 September 2009. The report also stated that the applicant had continued to express feelings of despair throughout his in-patient treatment. He was described as suffering from moderate depression.\n\nOn 18 November 2009, the Acting President of the Fourth Section decided to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, indicating to the Government that it was in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicant should not be expelled to Nigeria pending the Court\u2019s decision. Rule 39 was initially applied by the Acting President for a period of two weeks, in order to give the Government the opportunity to comment on the applicant\u2019s mental health history and to state whether any special measures had been put in place to alleviate the risk of suicide prior to and during his proposed removal.\n\nBy letter dated 2 December 2009, the Government informed the Court that they had not previously been aware of the applicant\u2019s attempted suicide, but had now considered the psychiatric report of 14 September 2009. As regards the logistics of the applicant\u2019s removal, the Government stated that all appropriate measures to protect the applicant from risk were already in place at the centre at which he was detained. Trained members of staff were aware of the applicant\u2019s situation and the applicant was under constant supervision. As to the risk during removal, the contractor effecting removal would be informed and a suitable escort would be provided, including a medical escort if deemed necessary. The applicant would be escorted up until the point of arrival in Nigeria. The Government also considered that there were sufficient mental health facilities in Nigeria, which would be available to the applicant if needed. The Government therefore invited the Court to lift the interim measure which had been indicated in respect of the applicant. However, on 8 December 2009, the Acting President decided to prolong until further notice the interim measure under Rule 39.\n\nThe applicant notified the authorities in the immigration detention centre that he had taken an overdose of paracetamol on 29 December 2009. He was assessed by the medical team and found only to have taken a few tablets. No further concerns as to his well-being appear to have been raised and the applicant was released from immigration detention on 13 January 2010. He does not claim to have made any further attempts at suicide.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 57592/08) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Arthur Hutchinson (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 10 November 2008.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Kyles Legal Practice, North Shields. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. McKell of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant alleged in particular that his whole life sentence gave rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). On 10 July 2013 the complaint concerning Article 3 was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court. In its judgment of 3 February 2015, a Chamber of the Fourth Section composed of Judges Raimondi, Nicolaou, Bianku, Tsotsoria, Kalaydjieva, Mahoney and Wojtyczek, and also of F. Arac\u0131, Deputy Section Registrar, declared by a majority the applicant\u2019s Article 3 complaint admissible. The Chamber also held, by six votes to one, that there had been no violation of Article 3. A dissenting opinion of Judge Kalaydjieva was appended to the judgment.\n\nOn 1 June 2015, pursuant to a request by the applicant dated 5 March 2015, the Panel of the Grand Chamber decided to refer the case to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention.\n\nThe composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 26 \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 of the Convention and Rule 24 of the Rules of Court.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed written observations (Rule 59 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court) on the merits. In addition, third-party comments were received from the European Prison Litigation Network (the \u201cEPLN\u201d), which had been granted leave to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court). The Government replied to these comments in the course of their oral submissions at the hearing (Rule 44 \u00a7 6 of the Rules of Court).\n\nA hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 21 October 2015 (Rule 59 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr P. McKell, Agent, Mr J. Wright QC, Attorney-General, Mr J. Eadie QC, Counsel, Ms A. Foulds, Ms C. Gaskell, Mr J. Gerard, Ms J. Earl, Advisers; (b) for the applicant Mr J. Bennathan QC, Ms K. Thorne, Counsel, Mr J. Turner, Adviser. The Court heard addresses by Mr Wright and Mr Bennathan, and their answers to questions put by the Court.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1941 and is detained in Her Majesty\u2019s Prison Durham.\n\nIn October 1983, the applicant broke into a family home, where he stabbed to death a man, his wife and their adult son. He then repeatedly raped their 18 year\u2011old daughter, having first dragged her past her father\u2019s body. He was arrested several weeks later and charged with these offences. At trial he pleaded not guilty, denying the killings and claiming that the sexual intercourse had been consensual. On 14 September 1984, he was convicted of three counts of murder, rape, and aggravated burglary.\n\nThe trial judge sentenced the applicant to a term of life imprisonment and, in accordance with the rules on sentencing then in force, recommended a minimum period (tariff) of 18 years to the Secretary of State for the Home Office. When asked to give his opinion again on 12 January 1988, the judge wrote that \u201cfor the requirements of retribution and general deterrence this is genuinely a life case\u201d. On 15 January 1988 the Lord Chief Justice recommended that the period should be set at a whole life term stating that \u201cI do not think that this man should ever be released, quite apart from the risk which would be involved\u201d. On 16 December 1994, the Secretary of State informed the applicant that he had decided to impose a whole life term.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the applicant applied to the High Court for a review of his sentence, arguing that he should receive the 18-year tariff mentioned at his trial. On 16 May 2008, the High Court gave its judgment. It found that there was no reason to depart from the Secretary of State\u2019s decision. The seriousness of the offences alone was such that the starting point was a whole life order. A number of very serious aggravating factors were present, and no mitigating factors. On 6 October 2008, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 21377/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ahmet Kenan Er (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 30 April 2004. The applicant was represented by Mr H.\u0130. Er, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 18 November 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the criminal proceedings to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 10 October 1990 the applicant, who served as a first lieutenant in the Turkish Armed Forces at the material time, was arrested on suspicion of, inter alia, professional misconduct and bribery.\n\nOn 28 March 1991 the military prosecutor at the 33rd Infantry Division Commander's office filed an indictment charging the applicant with twenty-four different offences, including professional misconduct, bribery and assault and battery of his inferiors.\n\nOn 12 May 1993 the K\u0131rklareli Military Court acquitted the applicant in relation to certain charges and found him guilty of the remaining offences.\n\nOn 19 January 1994 the Military Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court in relation to certain offences and quashed the remainder of the judgment on grounds of, inter alia, insufficient investigation.\n\nOn 7 November 1995 the K\u0131rklareli Military Court acquitted the applicant in relation to certain charges and found him guilty as charged for the remaining offences.\n\nOn 6 March 1996 the Military Court of Cassation partially upheld the first-instance court's judgment.\n\nOn 16 April 1996 the K\u0131rklareli Military Court once again acquitted the applicant in relation to certain charges and found him guilty of the remaining offences.\n\nOn 9 May 1997 the applicant was expelled from the armed forces.\n\nOn 10 June 1998 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on procedural grounds in relation to certain charges and for being time-barred (zamana\u015f\u0131m\u0131) in relation to the remainder.\n\nOn 5 August 1999 the \u00c7orlu Military Court found the applicant guilty as charged in relation to those offences which were not time-barred and of which he had not already been acquitted.\n\nOn 28 March 2001 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court once again in the light of a recent amendment to the relevant jurisdictional rules, and held that the case should be heard by ordinary criminal courts.\n\nOn 26 December 2001 the \u00c7orlu Military Court issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction and referred the case to the K\u0131rklareli Assize Court.\n\nOn 2 December 2003 the K\u0131rklareli Assize Court decided to discontinue the proceedings against the applicant as the prosecution had become time-barred.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 45288/99) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Jan Ci\u0105gadlak (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 4 May 1998.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nOn 4 December 2001 the Fourth Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1929 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nOn 2 April 1992 the applicant filed with the Warsaw Regional Court (s\u0105d wojew\u00f3dzki) a petition in which he requested the annulment of a judgment delivered in 1947 in criminal proceedings against him, submitting that they had been of a political nature. He also claimed compensation.\n\nOn 10 February 1993 the court annulled that judgment. However, its decision did not relate to the compensation claim.\n\nOn 19 February 1993 the applicant filed another compensation claim.\n\nSubsequently, he lodged several complaints concerning the inactivity of the court, but to no avail.\n\nIn her letters of 15 December 1993 and 29 June 1994, in reply to the applicant's complaints, a judge of the Regional Court informed the applicant that the delay in the examination of his compensation claim was caused by a large number of similar requests lodged with that court and the dearth of judges.\n\nOn 22 February 1995 the court held a hearing. A public prosecutor requested that the proceedings be stayed, submitting that a part of the Regional Court's decision of 10 February 1993 was invalid and required supplementation. Subsequently, the court stayed the proceedings.\n\nThe hearing scheduled for 22 March 1995 was adjourned at the applicant's request.\n\nOn 4 April 1995 the Regional Court asked the Office for the State Protection (Urz\u0105d Ochrony Pa\u0144stwa) to submit certain documents. The documents were submitted to the court on 27 March 1996.\n\nOn 4 July 1996 the proceedings were resumed.\n\nThe court adjourned the hearing scheduled for 23 January 1997, as the proceedings concerning the annulment of the criminal judgment against the applicant given in 1947 had not been completed.\n\nOn 19 June 2000 the Warsaw Regional Court gave judgment. It awarded the applicant PLN 7,500 in compensation. He did not lodge an appeal against that judgment.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 44521/04) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Leszek Ko\u0142odzi\u0144ski (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 19 August 2004.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 12 April 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s correspondence to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Gda\u0144sk, Poland.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant\n\nOn 16 July 2004 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of robbery. On 17 July 2004 the Gda\u0144sk District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody until 16 October 2004. It found that there were reasonable grounds \u2013 in particular, evidence from witnesses \u2013 for suspecting him of the offence charged. The court further noted that the applicant was liable to a statutory maximum sentence of at least 12 years\u2019 imprisonment. It also found that there was a risk that the applicant might tamper with evidence.\n\nOn 11 October 2004 the Gda\u0144sk District Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention until 16 January 2005. It considered that the reasons for keeping him in detention were still valid and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation justified holding him in custody. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. It also found that there was a risk that the applicant might tamper with evidence, given the nature of the charges against him and the fact that he had acted with other co-accused.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s detention was subsequently prolonged by the District Court on unspecified dates. The courts\u2019 decisions were based on Article 258 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which lists grounds for pre-trial detention, such as, the risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding or a justified fear that an accused will attempt to induce witnesses or co-defendants to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of proceedings by any other unlawful means.\n\nOn 27 October 2005 the Gda\u0144sk District Court convicted the applicant of two counts of robbery and sentenced him to 3 years and 6 months\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 26 September 2006 the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) upheld the impugned judgment.\n\nThe applicant did not lodge a cassation appeal.\n\nB. Censorship of the applicant\u2019s correspondence\n\nThe applicant\u2019s letter to the Court dated 24 November 2004 bears a stamp marked \u201ccensored\u201d (cenzurowano), \u201cthe prosecutor\u201d (prokurator) followed by an illegible signature. It appears that the envelope in which that letter was sent had been cut open and subsequently resealed with adhesive tape. According to the postmark the letter was posted on 8 December 2004.\n\nThe application form submitted by the applicant and dated 13 January 2005 bears a stamp marked \u201ccensored\u201d (cenzurowano), \u201cthe judge\u201d (s\u0119dzia) followed by an illegible signature. The envelope bears a stamp confirming that the applicant\u2019s letter was received for dispatch by the prison administration on 18 January 2005. However, according to the postmark the letter was not posted until 31 January 2005. It also appears that the envelope was cut open and subsequently resealed with adhesive tape.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe cases originated in applications (nos. 28309/06 and 48102/06) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Polish nationals, Ms Gra\u017cyna Walto\u015b and Ms Wanda Pawlicz (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 30 June 2006.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr M. Werner, a lawyer practising in Szczecin-Mierzyn. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 21 June 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1949 and 1956, respectively, and live in Koszalin.\n\nA. Civil proceedings for payment\n\nOn 1 August 1997 the applicants filed a claim with the Koszalin District Court against a housing co-operative concerning the amount of maintenance fees to be fixed in respect of their apartment building.\n\nOn 24 November 1998 the proceedings were stayed pending the termination of parallel proceedings relating to the alleged nullity of an amendment made to the co-operative\u2019s statute. The Koszalin District Court resumed the proceedings on 7 March 2003.\n\nOn 13 May 2003 a hearing was held. The court requested the Koszalin Regional Court to provide the case-file of the proceedings relating to the alleged nullity of an amendment made to the co-operative\u2019s statute.\n\nOn 16 June 2003 the Koszalin District Court decided to stay the proceedings at the applicants\u2019 request. They were resumed, upon the applicants\u2019 request, on 17 November 2004.\n\nHearings were subsequently held on 23 February, 11 August, 22 September, 10 November and 9 December 2005.\n\nOn 30 January 2006 the Koszalin District Court decided to admit an expert opinion. On 6 June and 16 August 2006 the expert requested prolongation of the time-limit for submission of the opinion.\n\nOn 6 September 2006 the court summoned the expert to submit the opinion within 7 days.\n\nIn 2007 the District Court held 7 hearings.\n\n18 October 2007 the Koszalin District Court gave a judgment in the case.\n\nThe judgment was quashed on 27 February 2009 by the Koszalin Regional Court and the case remitted for re-examination.\n\nThe proceedings are currently pending before the first-instance court.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 30 November 2005 the applicants lodged a complaint under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d). On 6 January 2006 the Koszalin Regional Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 complaint, finding that the trial court could not be held responsible for any delays and that the proceedings had been prolonged as it had been necessary to stay them.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 34030/07) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Stanis\u0142aw Ja\u0142owiecki (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 3 August 2007.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms I. Korna\u015b-Pierzak, a lawyer practising in Cracow. The Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, inter alia, that the lustration proceedings in his case had been unfair, in violation of Article 6 of the Convention.\n\nOn 25 February 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Stronie \u015al\u0105skie.\n\nOn 3 August 1997 the Law of 11 April 1997 on disclosing work for or service in the State\u2019s security services or collaboration with them between 1944 and 1990 by persons exercising public functions (ustawa o ujawnieniu pracy lub s\u0142u\u017cby w organach bezpiecze\u0144stwa pa\u0144stwa lub wsp\u00f3\u0142pracy z nimi w latach 1944-1990 os\u00f3b pe\u0142ni\u0105cych funkcje publiczne) (the \u201c1997 Lustration Act\u201d) entered into force.\n\nOn 14 April 2004 the applicant, a candidate for the European Parliament, declared that he had not collaborated with the communist-era secret services. He was subsequently elected as a Member of the European Parliament.\n\nOn 9 December 2004 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) decided to institute lustration proceedings against the applicant following a request made by the Commissioner of the Public Interest (Rzecznik Interesu Publicznego) on the grounds that the applicant had lied in his lustration declaration by denying that he had cooperated with the secret services.\n\nOn 17 February 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the first\u2011instance lustration court, found that the applicant had submitted an untrue lustration declaration since he had been an intentional and secret collaborator with the State\u2019s secret services. The court established that the applicant had met on probably two occasions in 1973 with agents of the secret services and had agreed to help them as a consultant.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision. He submitted that he had never collaborated with the secret services and the meeting in question had been in connection with the preparation of an article. The applicant also referred to his subsequent activity in the \u201cSolidarno\u015b\u0107\u201d movement for which he had been persecuted and detained by the communist authorities. Subsequently, he was allowed to leave Poland and between 1985 and 1994 he was a deputy of the Polish Section of Radio Free Europe in Munich.\n\nOn 6 June 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal, acting as the second\u2011instance lustration court, upheld the impugned judgment.\n\nOn 1 February 2007 the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) dismissed the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal. That decision was notified to the applicant on 8 March 2007.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 38426/03) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Ms Lidia Nowak (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 9 October 2003.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 8 October 2007 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Libert\u00f3w.\n\nA. Main proceedings\n\nOn 18 November 1993 the applicant divorced.\n\nOn 17 June 1994 she lodged with the Krak\u00f3w District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) a claim for division of matrimonial property consisting of a family house in Jank\u00f3wka and a right to a flat in a housing-co-operative in Krak\u00f3w.\n\nBetween 8 November 1994 and 2 August 2000, the Krak\u00f3w District Court scheduled forty-five hearings, nine of which were adjourned and one expert report was obtained.\n\nOn 13 December 2000 the court issued an interim order (zarz\u0105dzenie tymczasowe) securing the applicant\u2019s claim. On 19 December 2000 the defendant appealed against the making of the order. On 19 July 2001 the court amended its order.\n\nAt a hearing held on 16 November 2001 the Krak\u00f3w District Court gave a preliminary decision (postanowienie wst\u0119pne) on the parties\u2019 respective shares in the matrimonial property.\n\nThe applicant and the defendant appealed on 4 February and 12 March 2002, respectively.\n\nOn 24 January 2003 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) amended the preliminary decision and dismissed the defendant\u2019s appeal. His cassation appeal was rejected on 22 April 2003 on procedural grounds.\n\nOn 15 March 2004 the court ordered that an expert report be obtained. The report was submitted on 30 July 2004.\n\nOn 11 October 2005 the court held a hearing.\n\nOn 7 February 2006 the court ordered that the third expert report be obtained.\n\nAt a hearing held on 29 December 2006 the applicant\u2019s lawyer made a friendly-settlement proposal. The court stayed the proceedings.\n\nOn 20 July 2007 the District Court resumed the proceedings and delivered a partial decision (postanowienie cz\u0119\u015bciowe) in the case, concerning the composition of the matrimonial property. The defendant appealed against this decision. On 7 April 2008 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court rejected the defendant\u2019s appeal.\n\nThe proceedings are still pending.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 23 November 2004 the applicant lodged with the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court a complaint under section 5 of the Law on 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d).\n\nShe sought a ruling declaring that the length of the proceedings before the Krak\u00f3w District Court had been excessive and an award of just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) (approx. 2,500 euros (EUR)).\n\nOn 13 January 2005 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court dismissed her complaintin the part alleging., to the Supreme Court. The court observed that the proceedings had indeed been lengthy but it was the applicant\u2019s husband who had been responsible for the delay in examination of the case. The court categorically stated that the Krak\u00f3w District Court was not responsible for the protracted length of the proceedings.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 59738/00) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr January Jagie\u0142\u0142o (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 30 August 1999.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 1 December 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government.\n\nApplying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nOn 28 November 1995, the applicant, who is a taxi driver by profession, was involved in a traffic accident.\n\nOn 28 February 1996 the applicant was charged with causing the accident. On 2 September 1997 the applicant was served with a bill of indictment.\n\nThe hearing set for 16 March 1998 was adjourned due to the presiding judge\u2019s illness. On 11 July 2001 the Warsaw District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) held the first hearing in the case. The hearing set for 20 September 2001 was adjourned due to the witnesses\u2019 absence.\n\nOn 7 December 2001 the court ordered an expert opinion to be obtained. On 30 April 2002 the expert submitted his opinion to the court. The court ordered a supplementary opinion to be obtained.\n\nThe hearing set for 18 September 2002 was adjourned. At the hearing held on 7 November 2002 the Warsaw District Court gave judgment. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 6 June 2003 the Warsaw Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) quashed the first\u2011instance judgment and remitted the case.\n\nFollowing the remittal, on 23 September 2004 the Warsaw District Court gave judgment. The court sentenced the applicant to one year imprisonment stayed for two years. The applicant appealed.\n\nThe applicant filed a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (\u201c2004 Act\u201d). On 16 November 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court gave a decision and confirmed that the proceedings had indeed been lengthy. However, the court did not grant any compensation to the applicant.\n\nOn 29 April 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court held an appeal hearing and gave judgment. The judgment is final.\n\nOn 6 June 2005 the applicant again filed a complaint with the Supreme Court under the 2004 Act alleging that a copy of the final judgment had not yet been served on him. The Supreme Court rejected the complaint, on a later unknown date, as the applicant had never asked to be served with a copy of the final judgment.\n\nOn 21 February 2006 the applicant for the third time filed a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under the 2004 Act. On 29 September 2006 the court refused to deal with the merits of the complaint. The court held that the proceedings had already been terminated and therefore the complaint was groundless.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 63131/00) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Leszek G\u0119bura (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 12 May 2000.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that a delay in releasing him from prison had given rise to a violation of Article 5.\n\nOn 17 March 2005 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Starachowice.\n\nThe applicant was serving a prison sentence in Tarn\u00f3w Mo\u015bcice Prison following three separate convictions. The overall term of his imprisonment was due to come to an end on 6 January 2002.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Code applicable to re-offenders, the applicant became eligible for conditional release after having served three-quarters of the overall term of his imprisonment, namely on 6 January 1999. After that date, the applicant requested a court on several occasions to grant him conditional release. However, his requests were denied on grounds of insufficient progress in his rehabilitation. On 20 March 2000 the prison governor requested the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) to order the applicant's release (warunkowe przedterminowe zwolnienie) in view of his satisfactory rehabilitation. The Tarn\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor objected to that request.\n\nOn 22 March 2000 the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court gave a decision ordering the applicant's conditional release for a three-year probationary period. It placed the applicant under the court officer's supervision and imposed certain other obligations on him.\n\nThe Tarn\u00f3w Regional Prosecutor appealed against that decision. The Regional Court did not amend its decision and transmitted the prosecutor's appeal to the Cracow Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny).\n\nThe hearing before the Court of Appeal was scheduled for 12 April 2000 at 8.45 a.m. On that day the Cracow Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Regional Court. No further appeal lay against the decision of the Court of Appeal. In the applicant's submission, the Court of Appeal's decision was delivered at 9 a.m.\n\nLater on 12 April 2000, a certified copy of the Court of Appeal's decision was sent to the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court, which received it on 13 April 2000. On the same day the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court ordered the governor of the Tarn\u00f3w Mo\u015bcice Prison to release the applicant and served him with a copy of the Court of Appeal's decision. The governor received these documents on 14 April 2000.\n\nAccording to the official release certificate, the applicant was released on 14 April 2000. The applicant submitted that he had been released on that date at 4 p.m.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 1303/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Peter James Lewis (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 4 April 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms A. Bromley, a solicitor practising in Nottingham. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Grainger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant invoked Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention in relation to the covert recording by the police of conversations in his cottage.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 8 July 2003, the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nNeither party filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 3 in fine).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is a United Kingdom national, who was born in 1944 and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in HMP Maidstone.\n\nThe applicant and his wife frequently travelled between various European countries. On 16 April 1997, the Chief Constable of South Wales authorised the installation of covert recording devices at the applicant's cottage and this was carried out on 23 April 1997. Authority for a further 28 days' surveillance was granted on 14 May 1997.\n\nOver 160 hours of tapes were obtained between the period of 25 April to 9 June 1997, on which latter date the applicant and his wife were arrested. The transcripts of the taped conversations made up the bulk of the case against the applicant.\n\nAt trial, the applicant's defence alleged that the recorded discussions, which occurred while he and the others concerned were under the influence of drugs, were \u201cdrug-crazed ramblings\u201d and challenged their admissibility. A \u201cvoir dire\u201d took place from 28 May to 1 June 1998, during which the defence made submissions concerning the procedure for authorisation of the surveillance and seeking inter alia to exclude irrelevant or prejudicial material under sections 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). By agreement, the transcript evidence was reduced from five to two files and an agreed schedule was adopted by all counsel concerning the occasions on which the conversations occurred at the same time as drug taking. In summing up to the jury at the conclusion of the trial, the judge directed their attention to the fact that the supposedly incriminating statements taped at the cottage were or may have been the product of the participants' intoxicated state and that it was for them to assess whether despite the drugs the defendants were expressing rational, genuine thoughts, real ideas, plans or arrangements.\n\nOn 15 June 1998, the applicant was convicted of charges inter alia of conspiracy to import controlled drugs and possession of controlled drugs in connection with importation of marijuana and cocaine from overseas. He was sentenced to a total of fifteen years' imprisonment. A confiscation order was imposed on him on 24 September 1998 in the sum of 50,169.18 pounds sterling (GBP).\n\nOn 10 November 1999, a single judge of the Court of Appeal refused an extension of time to appeal against sentence and refused leave to appeal against conviction, noting that no satisfactory or sufficient reason had been given for the 11 month delay in lodging the application. The applicant's renewed application was refused by the Court of Appeal on 17 October 2000.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 19 February 1993, within the three-month period laid down in Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 14220/88) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish national, Mr G\u00f6ran Ravnsborg, on 2 July 1988. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings. The President granted him leave to present his own case (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mrs E. Palm, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 27 February 1993 the Vice-President, Mr R. Bernhardt, drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the other seven members, namely Mr Th\u00f3r Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Mr F. G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc, Mr F. Matscher, Mr A. N Loizou, Sir John Freeland, Mr J. Makarczyk and Mr D. Gotchev (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Swedish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201c), the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government\u2019s memorial on 23 July 1993 and the applicant\u2019s memorial on 23 August. On 17 September the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate did not intend to file a memorial in reply. On 5 and 15 October 1993 the Commission produced a number of documents, as requested by the Registrar on the President\u2019s instructions, and the applicant submitted his claims under Article 50 (art. 50).\n\nIn accordance with the President\u2019s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 25 October 1993. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Ms E. Jagander, Legal Adviser, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Agent, Ms C. Renfors, Legal Adviser, Ministry of Justice, Adviser;\n\nfor the Commission Mr Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson, Delegate;\n\nthe applicant Mr G. Ravnsborg. The Court heard addresses by Ms Jagander, Mr Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson and Mr Ravnsborg.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. Introduction\n\nMr G\u00f6ran Ravnsborg, a university lecturer in law, is a Swedish citizen and lives in Lund in Sweden.\n\nFrom late 1981 the applicant held a power of attorney from his adoptive mother, Mrs Karin Schieck, and, on 19 November 1982, he was appointed administrator (god man) for her friend, Mrs Marie \u00c5kerblom. As both Mrs Schieck and Mrs \u00c5kerblom became unable to care for themselves because of their advanced age, they were placed in a nursing home by the Municipality of G\u00f6teborg. The nursing home charged them for medical care and the applicant effected the relevant payments. When he subsequently realised that the nursing home was a charitable association, he stopped paying the fees on the ground that the institution in question was not entitled to charge them. A dispute arose between the applicant and the nursing home and the latter brought a court action.\n\nOn 6 April 1987, while the above-mentioned proceedings were pending, the Board of the Principal Guardian (\u00d6verf\u00f6rmyndarn\u00e4mnden - \u201cthe Board\u201c) in G\u00f6teborg asked the District Court (tingsr\u00e4tten) in the same town to appoint an administrator for Mrs Schieck. The applicant, on his own and Mrs Schieck\u2019s behalf, filed a counter-claim and sought the immediate dismissal of the members of the Board. Referring to Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, he asked for a public hearing.\n\nOn three occasions in the course of the ensuing proceedings the applicant was ordered by the relevant courts, under Chapter 9, Article 5, of the Code of Judicial Procedure (r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken; see paragraphs 19-20 below), to pay fines for improper (otillb\u00f6rliga) statements made in his written observations. The orders were made in the form of decisions (beslut). He appears to have paid the fines.\n\nB. The first fine\n\nIn his written observations of 4 May 1987 to the District Court he stated, inter alia, that the Board could be described as \u201ca basket of municipal rotten eggs of different colours with a common denominator and overriding ideology, namely fascism\u201c. Accordingly, the rights and legitimate interests of individuals within the municipality - if these were taken into account at all, so intoxicated were the authorities with power - were never given proper consideration amounting to an effective examination of the needs of the community. As a result, such needs were defined by so-called democratically elected \u201cpeoples\u2019 courts\u201c - officially named \u201cboards\u201c and \u201ccouncils\u201c of the municipality of G\u00f6teborg - the members of which \u201cconsist[ed] to a surprising degree of the local public mob\u201c or \u201cpure rotten eggs\u201c.\n\nThe District Court, considering the applicant\u2019s statements \u201cimproper\u201c within the meaning of Chapter 9, Article 5, of the Code of Judicial Procedure, ordered him, at a sitting on 18 May 1987, to pay a fine of 1,000 Swedish kronor. It did not hold a hearing and adjourned its examination of the merits of the case (see paragraph 15 below).\n\nC. The second fine\n\nOn 1 June 1987 the applicant appealed from the above decision to the Court of Appeal for Western Sweden (Hovr\u00e4tten f\u00f6r V\u00e4stra Sverige). He asked for an oral hearing and complained of not having had the possibility to defend himself orally before the District Court. In his written observations, the applicant informed the Court of Appeal that, should it refuse his demands, he intended to lodge a further appeal (presumably to the Supreme Court) in order to bring his case to the Commission in Strasbourg or to the Human Rights Committee in Geneva. He expressed the opinion that the likelihood of his being granted leave to appeal was very small in view of the \u201cgenerally lethargic[,]... lax and allergic attitude of the final instance\u201c, which resulted from the \u201canti-human rights indoctrination received by its members during their many years\u2019 service in public administration\u201c.\n\nOn 4 November 1987, without holding an oral hearing, the Court of Appeal confirmed the District Court\u2019s decision and ordered the applicant to pay a further fine of 1,000 kronor, finding that his written observations of 1 June 1987 also contained improper remarks prejudicing the good order of court proceedings.\n\nThe applicant then applied to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal, alleging that the lower and appellate courts had not only denied him a fair trial but had also violated his right to freedom of expression. Such leave was refused on 5 January 1988.\n\nD. The third fine\n\nIn the meantime, on 17 June 1987, the District Court, without holding a hearing, accepted the applicant\u2019s and Mrs Schieck\u2019s objection against the Board\u2019s request for the appointment of an administrator, but rejected their demand for the dismissal of the members of the Board (see paragraph 8 above).\n\nOn 2 July 1987 the applicant, on his own and Mrs Schieck\u2019s behalf, lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal, seeking to have the case referred back to the District Court for reconsideration, as well as an oral hearing before the lower court. On this occasion, he asked that his case be heard by a specially composed District Court as he wished to have certain members disqualified from sitting. He alleged that one of its members, whom he named, had a \u201cfar-reaching tendentiously fascist way of presiding\u201c over the court and was \u201cgrossly partial in favour of municipal interests, collegiate corruption and abuse of public power through high-handedness, terror and reactionary principles\u201c. When composed of the said judge and certain other members, who were also mentioned by name, the District Court had been generally autocratic and had applied the law in a manner which had been heavily in favour of the municipal authorities. On 4 November 1987, in a separate decision from the one mentioned in paragraph 13 above, the Court of Appeal rejected the appeal. In addition, it again ordered the applicant to pay 1,000 kronor for improper remarks in his appeal. It did not hold a hearing.\n\nThe applicant, on his own behalf and on that of Mrs Schieck\u2019s estate (the latter had died on 7 July 1987), applied to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal, which was refused on 5 January 1988 (in a different decision from that referred to in paragraph 14 above).",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 47328/99) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Nurettin \u015eirin (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 15 March 1999.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. Arani, a lawyer practising in Middlesex (United Kingdom). The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 27 April 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal and the failure to notify the applicant of the public prosecutor\u2019s submissions on his appeal to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1964, resides in Istanbul.\n\nOn 31 January 1997 the applicant made a speech about the liberation movement in Palestine and praised the Muslim leaders who worked for the liberation of Jerusalem during a meeting which was organised by the Sincan District Council in Ankara.\n\nOn 6 February 1997 the applicant was taken into police custody. In his statement, he explained that he supported the Iranian regime and that he longed for a regime that was based on the Koran.\n\nOn 13 February 1997 the applicant was questioned by the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security Court. During his questioning by the prosecutor, the applicant repeated his police statement. On the same day the applicant was brought before the investigating judge attached to the Ankara State Security Court and he was subsequently placed in detention on remand.\n\nIn an indictment dated 7 March 1997, the Ankara State Security Court public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant.\n\nBefore the Ankara State Security Court, which was composed of three judges including a military judge, the applicant contested the charges against him.\n\nOn 15 October 1997 the Ankara State Security Court convicted the applicant of being a member of an illegal organisation and sentenced him to seventeen years and six months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to Article 168 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 6 January 1998 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation. The Chief Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion on the merits of the appeal. The opinion was not notified to the applicant, but was read out during the hearing before the Court of Cassation.\n\nOn 21 September 1998 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, upholding the Ankara State Security Court\u2019s assessment of evidence and its reasons for rejecting the applicant\u2019s defence.\n\nOn 24 December 1998 the Chief Public Prosecutor attached to the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant\u2019s request for rectification.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31721/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Hasan Demirkaya (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 13 May 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. Rollas, a lawyer practising in \u0130zmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 18 January 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1978 and lives in \u0130zmir.\n\nOn 8 October 2001, the applicant was taken into police custody in \u0130zmir on suspicion of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, namely the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party). During his police custody, the applicant signed a form explaining arrested persons' rights, whereby he was reminded of his right to remain silent. On 9 October 2001 the police officers interrogated the applicant at the Anti-Terrorism department of the Izmir Security Directorate, in the absence of a lawyer. The applicant admitted that he had aided and abetted the PKK and acted as courier for the organisation. Another accused, N.S. was also arrested in the course of the operation. In his police statement, N.S. stated that he was a member of the PKK and that he had stayed at the applicant's house when he had come to Izmir and maintained that the applicant had acted as a PKK courier and helped him in certain illegal activities.\n\nOn 12 October 2001 the applicant was questioned by the public prosecutor and he denied that he had been involved in the PKK. He also claimed that he had signed his police statement without reading it.\n\nOn the same day, the applicant was brought before the investigating judge, who questioned him and sixteen other suspects in relation to their involvement in the PKK. The applicant's lawyer was also present during the questioning. In his statement to the investigating judge, the applicant denied all the charges against him. After the interrogation, the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention on the order of the judge.\n\nIn an indictment dated 19 October 2001, the Public Prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court charged the applicant and fifteen others with aiding and abetting an illegal organisation. The charges were brought under Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713 (the anti-terrorist law).\n\nDuring the trial, the applicant denied any connection with the PKK. Furthermore N.S., one of the co-defendants, admitted to being a PKK member before the court, but stated that although he had stayed at the applicant's house when he had come to Izmir, the applicant did not know that he was a PKK member. In this connection, N.S. rejected his police statement, alleging that it had been taken under duress. On 20 June 2002 the Izmir State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to three years and nine months' imprisonment. In convicting the applicant, the Izmir State Security Court relied on the applicant's police statement, which had been taken in the absence of a lawyer. The court further took into consideration the police statement of N.S. who had given evidence that the applicant had been involved in the activities of the PKK. It therefore concluded that the applicant's police statement, in which he had admitted to his involvement in the PKK, had been confirmed by other evidence in the case file.\n\nOn 10 October 2003 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant's appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 55853/00) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Swedish national, Mr Robert Edward Miller (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 9 April 1999.\n\nThe applicant was represented before the Court by Mr Ulf Jacobson, a juris candidate practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by Mrs E. Jagander of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs as their Agent.\n\nOn 9 December 2003 the Court decided to communicate to the Government the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention concerning the refusal to hold an oral hearing. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1918 and lives in Stockholm. Until his retirement in March 1983 he worked as a teacher for 17 hours per week.\n\nOn 26 August 1996 the applicant applied for disability benefits (handikappers\u00e4ttning) under Chapter 9, section 2 of the Social Insurance Act 1962 (Lagen om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring, 1962:381 - hereinafter \u201cthe 1962 Act\u201d). He claimed that, even before his 65th birthday in 1983, he had incurred extra costs due to his illness, Charcot-Marie-Tooth0, from which he had suffered since the 1970's and which had been diagnosed in September 1982. In support of his claim, he submitted:\n\n(i) A medical certificate dated 27 August 1996, produced by the applicant's general practitioner, Doctor P. Dekany, at the applicant's request, supporting his application for disability benefits. It stated that the doctor had known and treated the applicant since 1961, and that the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease had started in the early 1970s involving difficulties in walking, problems of balance, dragging of the feet and the patient tripping over and falling continuously. The muscles in the legs and feet had considerably withered. The illness had attacked even the hands and arms, with withered muscles and reduced strength in the fingers. Because of multiple inconveniences, the patient's functional capacity had been strongly reduced; he needed help for heavier household tasks, the preparation of meals, the purchase of household goods, carrying heavier objects, and for personal hygiene. The patient had incurred extra costs for medical treatment, foot rails, soft shoes, home assistance, and to some extent his food budget because of a limited ability to prepare meals; he also had to pay for the transportation service for disabled persons, and extra travel by personal car, because of his considerably reduced ability to walk.\n\n(ii) A statement of 21 April 1997 by Doctor P. Dekany, reproducing extracts from the applicant's medical records for the period between 1975 and 1983, with a diagnosis of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in September 1982; (iii) A statement dated 23 March 1983 by Mr P.K. Thomas, Professor and Doctor of the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, University of London, which concluded: \u201cI quite agree that the diagnosis here is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The clinical findings and the nerve conduction studies indicate that it can be classified as type II hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. He does show some minor pyramidal signs in the legs, which may be associated. I have explained to Mr Miller that although his symptoms may continue slowly to deteriorate, this is unlikely ever to become a very serious incapacity so that he becomes unable to walk.\u201d 6. On 16 July 1997 the Social Insurance Office (f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan -hereinafter \u201cthe Office\u201d) of the County of Stockholm rejected the application, finding that the applicant's disability had not reached the level required under Chapter 9, section 2 before he turned 65 years of age. One member reserved his position, considering that the applicant's need for assistance before turning 65 should be investigated. 7. The applicant, represented by a lawyer, appealed to the County Administrative Court (l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten) of the County of Stockholm and requested that an oral hearing be held in his case because he wished to call as witnesses his personal doctor, the doctor appointed by the Office and all the members of the Office who had participated in the decision of his case. On 15 January 1998 the County Administrative Court refused the request with reference to section 9 of the Administrative Court Procedure Act (F\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen 1971:291 - hereinafter \u201cthe 1971 Act\u201d). Its decision contained the following reasoning: \u201cWritten material, which includes inter alia medical certificates and extracts from [the applicant's] medical journal, a multitude of submissions and other documents sent by [the applicant] as well as the diary notes made during the processing of the case before [the Office] ..., are available in the case. There are no uncertainties as regards, at least, the basis for the medical assessment. The uncertainty regarding [the applicant's] extra costs due to his disability at the age of 65 can be clarified satisfactorily by [him] in writing. According to the documents, [the applicant's] requests and reasons therefore are clearly defined, as are the submissions by the respondent. Nor has [the applicant] pointed to circumstances which would benefit from being orally presented by him. Thus, there is no reason to assume that an oral hearing could add anything meaningful. The County Administrative Court therefore considers an oral hearing to be unnecessary and rejects the request to that effect. ...\u201d The County Administrative Court invited the applicant to mention any further circumstances he wished to invoke and to submit his final written observations in the case within two weeks. In response he reiterated his request for an oral hearing, relying on Article 6 of the Convention. He argued that the medical certificates needed to be clarified and that a witness account by his personal doctor would be important in order to establish the exact level of support that he had required at the age of 65. He also submitted that the members of the Office should have been asked to give evidence about their precise reasons for refusing his request. 8. By a judgment of 13 February 1998 the County Administrative Court rejected the applicant's appeal on the grounds that the medical and other evidence in the case showed that, even before he had reached the age of 65, he had for a considerable time been functionally impaired, but not to such a degree that, on an assessment of the overall need of assistance, he was entitled to disability benefit. The court noted that the applicant had \u201ccommented\u201d (yttrat sig) on its rejection of his request for an oral hearing, but did not respond to his renewed request or his reasons invoked therein. In reaching this decision the County Administrative Court took note of a breakdown of additional costs allegedly caused by his disability, totalling SEK 18,100, which the applicant had initially submitted to the Social Insurance Office on 16 September 1996. 9. The applicant appealed against the lower court's judgment to the Stockholm Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarr\u00e4tten) requesting it to quash the judgment and refer the case back for fresh examination. In the alternative, he requested the appellate court to find that he was entitled to disability benefits at a level corresponding to 36 % of the basic amount as of July 1994. He further requested that the court hold an oral hearing, on the same grounds as those he had presented to the lower court. He submitted that, by refusing to hold an oral hearing, the latter had breached Article 6 of the Convention. 10. By a decision of 3 July 1998 the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected his request for an oral hearing, finding this unnecessary for determining whether to grant him leave to appeal, and gave him two weeks to complete his submissions in writing. The applicant made further submissions and maintained his request for an oral hearing. On 29 September 1998 the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected his renewed request for an oral hearing and refused him leave to appeal. 11. On 13 October 1998 the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten), observing that it did not normally hold oral hearings, rejected the applicant's request for a hearing and gave him three weeks within which to submit additional written observations. On 29 February 2000 it refused him leave to appeal. In this connection the applicant was given a copy of an analysis presented to the Supreme Administrative Court by its legal secretary, which included an opinion to the effect that the County Administrative Court's refusal to hold a hearing was not deemed incompatible with the Convention.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 47335/06) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Arthur Collins Redfearn (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 16 November 2006.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr P. Chapman of Mitchells Solicitors, a lawyer practising in York. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant complained, among other things, that he had been dismissed on account of his political views and membership of a political party.\n\nOn 7 January 2009 the Acting President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the complaints concerning Articles 10, 11 and 14 of the Convention to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Bradford.\n\nThe applicant was employed by Serco Limited (\u201cSerco\u201d) from 5 December 2003 to his dismissal on 30 June 2004. Serco provided transport to local authorities, including Bradford City Council.\n\nThe applicant, who is white British, was employed formerly as a driver\u2019s escort and latterly as a driver. As such, he was responsible for transporting children and adults with physical and/or mental disabilities within the Bradford area. The majority of his passengers were Asian in origin. There had been no complaints about his work or his conduct at work and his supervisor, who was of Asian origin, had nominated him for the award of \u201cfirst-class employee\u201d.\n\nOn 26 May 2004 a local newspaper article published in Bradford and the surrounding areas identified the applicant as a candidate for the British National Party (\u201cthe BNP\u201d) in the forthcoming local elections. On the same day, the applicant was temporarily assigned to deliver mail to local council offices.\n\nAt the relevant time the BNP only extended membership to white nationals. According to its constitution it was: \u201cwholly opposed to any form of integration between British and non-European peoples. It is therefore committed to stemming and reversing the tide of non-white immigration and to restoring, by legal changes, negotiation and consent, the overwhelmingly white makeup of the British population that existed in Britain prior to 1948.\u201d\n\nOn 27 May 2004 UNISON, the public sector workers\u2019 trade union, sent a letter to Serco stating that many of its members found the applicant\u2019s continued employment a \u201csignificant cause for concern, bearing in mind the BNP\u2019s overt and racist/fascist agenda.\u201d The letter advised Serco that 70-80 percent of its customer base and 35 percent of its workforce were of Asian origin. UNISON asked that Serco take immediate action to ensure its members were not subjected to racial hatred. Another trade union, GMB, and a number of employees also made representations to Serco about the applicant\u2019s continued employment.\n\nOn 15 June 2004 the applicant was elected as a local councillor for the BNP. After taking legal advice Serco summarily dismissed him on 30 June 2004. Serco cited, inter alia, potential health and safety risks as the applicant\u2019s continued employment would give rise to considerable anxiety among passengers and their carers. It also expressed concern that the applicant\u2019s continued employment could jeopardise its reputation and possibly lead to the loss of its contract with Bradford City Council.\n\nOrdinarily, one year\u2019s service is required before an employee can bring an action for unfair dismissal under the Employment Rights Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d), although this qualifying period does not apply where the dismissal was on grounds of pregnancy, race, sex or religion. The applicant therefore lacked sufficient continuous service to bring an action for unfair dismissal. However, on 12 August 2004 he lodged a statutory claim of race discrimination in the Employment Tribunal pursuant to the Race Relations Act 1976 (\u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d).\n\nThe applicant claimed that he had been unlawfully discriminated against as his dismissal constituted less favourable treatment on racial grounds. The racial grounds relied on were those of the passengers and employees of Serco who were of Asian origin. He further argued that since the BNP was a \u201cwhites-only\u201d party, his dismissal also constituted indirect racial discrimination.\n\nThe Employment Tribunal gave judgment on 2 February 2005. It noted Serco\u2019s concerns that the applicant\u2019s continued employment might lead to difficulties with other employees; damage its relationship with the unions; lead to attacks on Serco\u2019s minibuses which would jeopardise the health and safety of Serco\u2019s staff, its vulnerable passengers, and the applicant himself; cause considerable anxiety amongst Serco\u2019s passengers and those relatives/carers entrusting vulnerable passengers to its care; and damage its reputation so as potentially to place at risk existing contracts and future bids for work in the public sector and elsewhere.\n\nThe Employment Tribunal dismissed the claim of direct discrimination as it was satisfied that if any discrimination existed against the claimant it was not on racial grounds but rather on health and safety grounds. The Tribunal also dismissed the claim of indirect discrimination on the ground that the applicant\u2019s dismissal was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim, namely the maintenance of health and safety.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal with the Employment Appeal Tribunal. On 27 July 2005 his appeal was upheld on the ground that the Tribunal had erred in its construction of the phrase \u201con racial grounds\u201d by failing to interpret its meaning broadly and had not indicated how it had come to the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s dismissal was a proportionate means of achieving the aim of ensuring health and safety because, inter alia, there had been no consideration of any alternatives to dismissal.\n\nOn 9 September 2005 Serco was granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.\n\nOn 25 May 2006 the Court of Appeal allowed Serco\u2019s appeal and restored the order of the Employment Tribunal. Mummery LJ found the applicant\u2019s submission that he had been subjected to direct race discrimination to be wrong in principle and inconsistent with the purposes of the legislation.\n\nIn rejecting the claim of direct discrimination, the Court of Appeal noted that: \u201cMr Redfearn was treated less favourably not on the ground that he was white, but on the ground of a particular non-racial characteristic shared by him with a tiny proportion of the white population, that is membership of and standing for election for a political party like the BNP. Serco was not adopting a policy which discriminated on the basis of a dividing line of colour or race. Serco would apply the same approach to a member of a similar political party, which confined its membership to black people. The dividing line of colour or race was not made by Serco, but by the BNP which defines its own composition by colour or race. Mr Redfearn cannot credibly make a claim of direct race discrimination by Serco against him on the ground that he is white by relying on the decision of his own chosen political party to limit its membership to white people. The BNP cannot make a non-racial criterion (party membership) a racial one by the terms of its constitution limiting membership to white people. Properly analysed Mr Redfearn\u2019s complaint is of discrimination on political grounds, which falls outside the anti-discrimination laws.\u201d\n\nIn rejecting the claim of indirect discrimination, the following was noted: \u201cFor indirect discrimination ... it is necessary to identify a \u2018provision, criterion or practice\u2019 which Serco has applied or would apply equally to persons not of the same race or colour. ... Mr Redfearn ... failed to present the tribunal with a case, which satisfied the requisite elements of a claim for indirect race discrimination and upon which the tribunal could properly make a finding of indirect race discrimination.... The employment tribunal appears to have attempted itself a version of a \u2018provision, criterion or practice\u2019 in paragraph 5.6 of its decision (see paragraph 28 above). However, it is formulated too narrowly (membership of the BNP) to be meaningful. A provision of \u2018membership of the BNP\u2019 could not be applied to a person who was not of the same colour as Mr Redfearn, because only persons of the same colour as him (white) are eligible to be members of the BNP. A more general and meaningful provision along similar lines would be one applying to membership of a political organisation like the BNP, which existed to promote views hostile to members of a different colour than those that belonged to the organisation. If such a provision were applied, however, it would not put persons of the same race as Mr Redfearn \u2018at a particular disadvantage\u2019 when compared with other persons within section 1(1A) of the 1976 Act. All such political activists would be at the same disadvantage, whatever colour they were.\u201d\n\nLastly, with regard to the applicant\u2019s contention that he had been subjected to less favourable treatment arising from membership of a political party contrary to his Convention rights under Articles 9, 10, 11 and 14 and that this should have been taken into account in deciding whether indirect discrimination had been justified, the Court of Appeal stated that: \u201cThe 1998 Act does not assist Mr Redfearn in this case. He is not entitled to make a claim under it as Serco is not a public authority. Section 3 of the 1998 Act does not assist, as there is no respect in which the relevant provisions of the 1976 Act are incompatible with the Convention rights. As for justification under the 1976 Act I have already explained that it does not arise, as no case of indirect discrimination has been made out.\u201d\n\nThe applicant was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 8866/04) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Yassar Hussain (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 1 March 2004.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. Bromley of Lichfield Reynolds in Stoke-on-Trent. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Grainger, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nOn 16 February 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1981 and lives in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nThe applicant was arrested on 14 May 2002 on suspicion of having intimidated witnesses. In an identity parade held the same afternoon, he was positively identified by one of the two witnesses. The applicant states that this witness accepted in her original statement of evidence to the police that she was a heroin user and an inherently unreliable witness. The applicant was subsequently charged with five counts of doing acts tending and intended to pervert the course of public justice.\n\nThe applicant pleaded not guilty on 2 August 2002 and the trial was adjourned to the Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on 7 October 2002. On that date no judge was available and the trial was moved to 3 February 2003. On the second day of the trial the witness who had identified the applicant did not attend and the trial had to be aborted. At the re-listed trial on 15 September 2003, Counsel for the Crown addressed the court in the following terms: \u201cWhen this matter was listed for trial in February, [L.] attended on the first day. She wasn't called to give evidence and didn't come back on the second day. Certainly, that caused some concern. I think it is fair to say, at different stages of the entire case, she has blown slightly hot and cold. [L.] indicated to the police when they contacted her recently and, in fact, again yesterday, that she was reluctant to give evidence. She has attended court today and with my learned friend's permission, I have had the chance to sit down and have a chat to her. Your Honour, the reality is that she does not want to give evidence. She has personal reasons I don't propose to divulge in open court. She has formed a new relationship. She has moved on. She is trying very hard to put the events of this entire case behind her. She has satisfied the police who spoke to her yesterday and satisfied those who instruct me that no threats have been made toward her in relation to today's proceedings. She insists that there has been no contact from [the applicant] or others acting on his behalf. We don't feel that, due to the nature of this allegation, she ought to be compelled to give evidence in this case. Your Honour, there has been a very full discussion and the view we have taken is that without her evidence, plainly, we can't proceed. I offer no evidence. Verdicts must follow.\u201d\n\nThe applicant was duly acquitted. On his counsel's application for a defendant's costs order, the judge refused to make an order and stated: \u201cThat order will be refused. There is clear evidence on the court papers. The Crown have taken the view that they are not going to compel this witness although there is compelling evidence in respect of those matters. It is a discretion which I am afraid I am not going to exercise in your favour.\u201d\n\nThe applicant's attempted appeal was dismissed on 14 November 2003 as \u201cto be appealable as a sentence, the order must be contingent upon conviction. As the defendant's costs order only arises when a prosecution is unsuccessful, it cannot be a sentence and cannot be appealed at the Court of Appeal Criminal Division\u201d.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 21865/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Kemal Evcimen (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 28 January 2000.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr A. \u015eahin, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 31 August 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the alleged unfairness of the proceedings against the applicant on account of the lack of independence and impartiality of the Erzurum State Security Court to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Edirne.\n\nAt the material time, the applicant was the owner and editor of a local newspaper published in Trabzon, the \u00d6zg\u00fcr Karadeniz (\u201cThe Free Black Sea\u201d).\n\nOn 15 January 1995 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 20 January 1995 he was brought before a judge who ordered his detention on remand.\n\nOn 10 March 1995 the public prosecutor at the Erzincan State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, along with twenty-one other persons. The applicant was accused of membership of an illegal organisation, the DHKP-C (the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party- Front). According to the indictment, following his arrest, the applicant's house was searched by police officers who found illegal periodicals, newspapers, books and a bullet. The public prosecutor also alleged that the applicant had published a newspaper containing propaganda in support of the DHKP-C, participated in illegal demonstrations, put up posters, distributed leaflets supporting the DHKP-C and carried out activities in the Karadeniz University for the recruitment of new members for the illegal organisation.\n\nOn 13 March 1995 the applicant was transferred to the Erzurum special type prison.\n\nOn different dates in 1995, five other criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant before various courts, with charges of disseminating separatist propaganda and incitement to hatred and hostility through the medium of his newspaper.\n\nThe cases against the applicant and his co-accused were subsequently joined before the Erzincan State Security Court.\n\nFollowing promulgation of the Law no. 4210, which abolished the Erzincan State Security Court and established the Erzurum State Security Court, in 1997 the Erzurum State Security Court acquired jurisdiction over the case and the case-file was sent to it.\n\nOn 27 November 1998 the Erzurum State Security Court convicted the applicant under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the DHKP-C. The court found that two articles published in \u00d6zg\u00fcr Karadeniz on 15 November 1994 and 1 March 1995 contained separatist propaganda and incitement to hatred. It further found it established that the applicant had participated in illegal demonstrations, put up posters, distributed leaflets supporting the DHKP-C and carried out activities in the Karadeniz University for the recruitment of new members for the illegal organisation. The court sentenced the applicant to twelve years and six months' imprisonment.\n\nOn 18 November 1999 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 27 November 1998 in respect of the applicant.\n\nOn 29 May 2004 the applicant was conditionally released from prison.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 10262/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Turgut K\u00f6kl\u00fc (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 17 February 2004.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mrs S. Akat, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 6 September 2007 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nOn 10 March 1998 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of membership of an illegal armed organisation, namely the TIKB (the Revolutionary Communist Union of Turkey).\n\nOn 13 March 1998 he was brought before the public prosecutor and then the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court. The latter remanded him in custody on the same day.\n\nOn 17 March 1998 the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Istanbul State Security Court, charging the applicant with membership of an illegal organisation under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code.\n\nBetween 25 March 1998 and 21 March 2001, the court held nineteen hearings. During these hearings the Istanbul Security Court, relying on the state of the evidence, the nature of the offence, and the duration of his detention, refused to release the applicant.\n\nOn 21 March 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court pronounced its judgment and convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to twelve years and six months\u2019 imprisonment under Article 168 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 8 August 2001 the Court of Cassation quashed this judgment. The case was accordingly remitted to the Istanbul State Security Court.\n\nOn 17 September 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court resumed the trial. During the subsequent hearings, the court rejected the applicant\u2019s requests for release, having regard to the state of the evidence.\n\nAt the hearing on 1 June 2003, the applicant\u2019s lawyer once again requested the court to release the applicant. In her submissions, she also drew attention to the psychological state and treatment of the applicant. The court rejected this request. An appeal lodged in that connection was also dismissed by a further court on 28 August 2003.\n\nBy Law no. 5190, in June 2004 State Security Courts were abolished. Subsequently, the Istanbul Assize Court acquired jurisdiction over the case.\n\nOn 25 October 2004 the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested the court to release the applicant. On 1 November 2004 the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nAccording to the information made available to the Court by the parties to date, the case is apparently still pending before the Istanbul Assize Court.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court on 23 January 1995 by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) and on 26 January 1995 by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (\u201cthe Government\u201c), within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 19380/92) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 20 September 1991 by a British national, Mr Stephen Andrew Benham. The Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government's application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). The object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 5 and 6 (art. 5, art. 6) of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 5 May 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr Th\u00f3r Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Mr B. Walsh, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr I. Foighel, Mr L. Wildhaber, Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici and Mr D. Gotchev (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43).\n\nThe President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Bernhardt, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant's lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government's memorial on 27 July 1995 and the applicant's memorial on 7 August 1995.\n\nIn accordance with the President's decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 22 November 1995. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr M. Eaton, Deputy Legal Adviser, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr D. Pannick QC, Mr P. Duffy, Counsel, Mr M. Collon, Lord Chancellor's Department, Adviser; (b) for the Commission Mrs J. Liddy, Delegate; (c) for the applicant Mr B. Emmerson Professor A. Bradley, Counsel, Mr J. Wadham Adviser. The Court heard addresses by Mrs Liddy, Mr Emmerson and Mr Pannick.\n\nFollowing deliberations on 23 November 1995 the Chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of a Grand Chamber (Rule 51 para. 1).\n\nThe Grand Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr Ryssdal, President of the Court, Mr Bernhardt, Vice-President of the Court, and the other members and substitute judges (namely, Mr B. Repik, Mr F. G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc, Mr R. Pekkanen and Mr K. Jungwiert) of the Chamber which had relinquished jurisdiction (Rule 51 para. 2 (a) and (b)). On 5 December 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the seven additional judges called on to complete the Grand Chamber, namely Mr F. Matscher, Mr J. De Meyer, Mrs E. Palm, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr A.B. Baka, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha and Mr P. Jambrek (Rule 51 para. 2 (c)).\n\nHaving taken note of the opinions of the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the applicant, the Grand Chamber decided on 26 January 1996 that it was not necessary to hold a further hearing following the relinquishment of jurisdiction by the Chamber (Rule 38, taken together with Rule 51 para. 6).\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nOn 1 April 1990 Mr Benham became liable to pay a community charge of \u00a3325. Since he did not pay it, on 21 August 1990 the Poole Magistrates' Court ordered the issue of a liability order, entitling Poole Borough Council (\u201cthe charging authority\u201c) to commence enforcement proceedings against him (see paragraph 19 below, Regulations 29 and 39 (1)).\n\nMr Benham did not pay the amount owed, and bailiffs visited his parents' house (where he was living), but were told that he had no goods of any value there or elsewhere which could be seized by them and sold in order to pay the debt.\n\nUnder Regulation 41 of the Community Charge (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1989 (\u201cthe Regulations\u201c: see paragraph 19 below), if a person is found to have insufficient goods on which to levy outstanding community charge the charging authority may apply to a magistrates' court for an order committing him to prison. On such an application being made, the court must inquire in the presence of the debtor as to his present means and also whether his failure to pay which led to the liability order being made was due to wilful refusal or culpable neglect. The charging authority applied for such an order, and on 25 March 1991 Mr Benham appeared at the Poole Magistrates' Court for the inquiry required by the Regulations. He was not assisted or represented by a lawyer, although he was eligible for \u201cGreen Form\u201c legal advice and assistance before the hearing (see paragraph 29 below), and the magistrates could have made an order for Assistance by Way of Representation (\u201cABWOR\u201c) if they had thought it necessary (see paragraph 30 below).\n\nThe magistrates found that Mr Benham, who had 9 \u201cO\u201c level General Certificates of Secondary Education, had started a Government Employment Training Scheme in September 1989, but had left it in March 1990 and had not worked since. He had applied for income support, but had been turned down because it is not payable to those who are voluntarily unemployed, and he had no personal assets or income. On the basis of this evidence, the magistrates concluded that his failure to pay the community charge was due to his culpable neglect, \u201cas he clearly had the potential to earn money to discharge his obligation to pay\u201c. Accordingly, they decided that he ought to be sent to prison for thirty days unless he paid what was owing. Mr Benham was taken to Dorchester prison on the same day.\n\nOn 27 March 1991 a solicitor went on the record as representing Mr Benham and lodged a notice of appeal by way of case stated (see paragraph 21 below) and an application for bail pending appeal (see paragraph 22 below). Legal aid was obtained for the appeal, but not for the bail application, because it is not available for such proceedings. In the event, the solicitor appeared without payment before the magistrates on 28 March 1991 to apply for bail, but he was unsuccessful.\n\nOn 4 April 1991 Mr Benham's solicitor lodged an application for leave to apply for judicial review and for bail in the High Court. He was obliged to ask for judicial review, despite the fact that he had already lodged an appeal by way of case stated, because otherwise he could not have applied for bail in the High Court until the magistrates had stated a case (see paragraph 22 below). Bail was granted on 5 April 1991 and Mr Benham was thus released from prison, having served eleven days.\n\nThe Divisional Court heard the appeal by way of case stated and the application for judicial review together on 7 and 8 October 1991 (Regina v. Poole Magistrates, ex parte Benham, 8 October 1991, unreported). Mr Benham was represented and legally aided. The court noted that it had been necessary to apply for judicial review in order to get bail, but that the case stated procedure was more appropriate. Accordingly no order was made on the judicial review application.\n\nMr Justice Potts in the Divisional Court held that the magistrates had been mistaken in concluding that Mr Benham's failure to pay the community charge had been due to culpable neglect: \u201cIn my view this finding was wrong on the evidence available to the justices. In certain circumstances a failure on the part of the debtor to work and put himself in funds to pay the community charge might constitute culpable neglect. In my judgment, however, before such a finding could be sustained, at the very least there would have to be clear evidence that gainful employment, for which he was fit, was on offer to the debtor and that he had rejected or refused that offer. There was no such evidence in this case. In my judgment, the justices' finding of culpable neglect cannot be sustained on the evidence adduced before them.\u201c\n\nIn addition, he found that the decision to commit Mr Benham to prison would have been wrong even if there had been evidence of culpable neglect, because he did not have any means with which to pay the debt at the time of the hearing before the magistrates, and because \u201c[s]uch an order is only to be made if payment can be made and there is no other way of inducing the [debtor] to do so\u201c. In the circumstances it was incumbent upon them to consider the alternatives to immediate detention provided for by the Regulations: they could have suspended the term of imprisonment subject to such conditions as they thought fit, or refused to issue a warrant, since the local authority could have renewed their application at a later date if Mr Benham's circumstances had changed (see paragraph 19 below).\n\nMr Benham was not able to apply for compensation in respect of the time he spent in prison, because he was unable to show bad faith on the part of the magistrates, as was required by section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (see paragraph 28 below).",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was brought before the Court on 13 July 1989 by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) and on 8 September 1989 by the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden (\u201cthe Government\u201c), within the period of three months laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. The case originated in an application (no. 11581/85) against Sweden lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by Dr Peter Darby, a Finnish citizen, on 20 November 1984. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 9 and 14 of the Convention, Article 14 being taken together with Article 9 (art. 14+9) and with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1).\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mrs E. Palm, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 25 August 1989 the President of the Court drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the other five members namely, Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr C. Russo, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr N. Valticos and Mr I. Foighel (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nMr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant on the need for a written procedure (Rule 37 para. 1). He also granted a request from the applicant for legal aid (Rule 4 of the Addendum to the Rules of Court). Thereafter, in accordance with the President\u2019s Order, the Registrar received the applicant\u2019s and the Government\u2019s memorials on 28 February and 6 March 1990 respectively; in a letter of 6 April 1990 the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\n\nHaving consulted, through the Registrar, those who would be appearing before the Court, the President directed on 16 January 1990 that the oral proceedings should open on 22 May 1990 (Rule 38).\n\nThe hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr H. Corell, Ambassador, Under-Secretary for Legal and Consular Affairs, Agent, Mrs C. Westerling, Legal Adviser, Ministry of Finance, Mr C.-H. Ehrencrona, Legal Adviser, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission Mr J. A. Frowein, Delegate;\n\nfor the applicant Mr C. Palme, advokat, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr Corell for the Government, by Mr Frowein for the Commission and by Mr Palme for the applicant, as well as their replies to its questions. The applicant also made a short statement.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. General background\n\nThe applicant, Dr Peter Darby, is a Finnish citizen of British origin, born in 1926. In 1977 he was employed as a doctor by the Swedish State Railways in G\u00e4vle, Sweden. He rented a flat in the town, but spent the weekends with his family on the island of Lemland in the neutral and demilitarised Finnish archipelago of \u00c5land at the southern end of the Gulf of Bothnia. From the end of 1981 he worked as a doctor in the public health service in another Swedish town, Norrt\u00e4lje. Since August 1986 he has been working in \u00c5land.\n\nDuring the period when the applicant was working in Sweden his income from the above-mentioned posts was, in accordance with the convention between Sweden and Finland for the avoidance of double taxation (see paragraph 18 below), liable to Swedish tax. The applicant was allowed deductions for the cost of maintaining two homes as well as for travel expenses to and from \u00c5land. As he was considered not to be permanently resident in Sweden, he was, until 1979, taxed in the so-called Common District (gemensamma distriktet) and he paid only a reduced municipal tax (see paragraph 19 below).\n\nOn 1 January 1979 the law was amended, with the result that the applicant was no longer taxed in the Common District but in the municipality where he stayed, i.e. in G\u00e4vle (see paragraph 20 below). The deductions which had previously been allowed were no longer permitted and he now had to pay the full municipal tax, including a special tax to the Lutheran Church of Sweden (\u201cthe church tax\u201c - see paragraphs 21-23 below). He was informed by the tax authorities that he could not claim any reduction of the church tax unless he was formally registered as resident in Sweden (see paragraph 22 below).\n\nB. Dr Darby\u2019s appeal against the decision to tax him as a resident\n\nDr Darby appealed to the Joint Municipal Tax Court (mellankommunala skatter\u00e4tten) against the decision to treat him for tax purposes as having been resident in G\u00e4vle in 1979. He claimed that he should still be taxed in the Common District as he was not living in Sweden. In a judgment of 25 February 1982 the court dismissed the appeal.\n\nIn the meantime, on 19 February 1982, the applicant had obtained a decision from the National Tax Board (riksskatteverket) to the effect that if he travelled daily from \u00c5land to his work in Sweden he would not be regarded as a resident for the purposes of section 68 of the Municipal Tax Act 1928 (kommunalskattelagen - see paragraph 20 below) and would thus be taxed in the Common District. However, he found daily commuting to G\u00e4vleimpossible, and in 1982 he accordingly took on less responsible work with lower pay in Norrt\u00e4lje, to which he could just manage to commute from Lemland. As a result he was again taxed in the Common District and was not liable to the church tax.\n\nAn appeal by Dr Darby to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarr\u00e4tten) of Sundsvall against the Joint Municipal Tax Court\u2019s judgment was dismissed in a judgment of 22 October 1982 and on 15 October 1984 the Supreme Administrative Court (regeringsr\u00e4tten) refused an application by him for leave to appeal.\n\nC. Dr Darby\u2019s complaints regarding the obligation to pay full church tax\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned proceedings, the applicant submitted an appeal to the County Administrative Court (l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten) of G\u00e4vleborg County against the order to pay full church tax on his 1979 income, on the ground that he was neither a member of the Church of Sweden, nor a Swedish citizen nor resident in Sweden. In a judgment of 19 May 1981 the court dismissed the appeal, holding that the Tax (Reduction of Dissenters\u2019 Liability) Act (lag 1951:691 om viss lindring i skattskyldigheten f\u00f6r den som icke tillh\u00f6r svenska kyrkan, \u201cthe Dissenters Tax Act\u201c - see paragraph 22 below) did not apply to the applicant.\n\nDr Darby appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal of Sundsvall, which in a judgment of 22 October 1982 confirmed the judgment of the lower court. His application for leave to appeal was refused by the Supreme Administrative Court on 9 October 1984.\n\nThe applicant also lodged a complaint with the Parliamentary Ombudsman (justitieombudsmannen) concerning his obligation to pay tax for the religious activities of the Swedish Church. In his decision of 16 April 1982 the Ombudsman noted that the requirement in the Dissenters Tax Act that a person be formally registered as resident in Sweden (mantalsskriven, as defined in the Ordinance on the keeping of population records, folkbokf\u00f6ringsf\u00f6rordningen) in order to be able to apply for exemption from the church tax had been questioned on several occasions by various bodies, including Parliament. Although the problem raised by the applicant was a limited one, the Ombudsman concluded that it showed up an inconsistency in the tax legislation for which there was no objective justification and that it was understandable if this inconsistency caused irritation. In a letter of the same day to the Government, he proposed that the registration requirement should be abolished. As a result of this proposal the Dissenters Tax Act was subsequently amended accordingly (see paragraph 23 below).\n\nD. The church tax paid by the applicant\n\nDr Darby paid church tax in the amount of 1,336 Swedish kronor for the tax year 1979, 1,717 kronor for 1980 and 1,325 kronor for 1981. If he had been allowed the reduction provided for in the Dissenters Tax Act, he would have had to pay 401, 515 and 397 kronor, respectively (see paragraph 22 below).",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 46284/99) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ufuk Yan\u0131ko\u011flu (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 16 January 1999.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr K. Bayraktar, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 31 January 2002 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the remaining complaints to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, on 7 November 2002 the Court decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1971, lives in Ankara.\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nOn 12 November 1991 the applicant was arrested and placed in police custody by police officers from the Ankara Security Directorate on suspicion of his involvement in the activities of an illegal organisation, namely the TDKP/GKB (Turkish Revolutionary Communist Party / Young Communist Union).\n\nOn 19 November 1991 the applicant gave a statement to the police, allegedly under duress and confessed that he had been involved in certain illegal activities organised by the TDKP/GKB.\n\nOn 25 November 1991 the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court questioned the applicant in relation to his involvement in the TDKP/GKB. The applicant denied the content of his written statement of 19 November 1991 and alleged that it had been taken under duress.\n\nOn 26 November 1991 the applicant was brought before a single judge of the Ankara State Security Court, who after taking his statement ordered his release.\n\nOn 30 December 1991 the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court filed an indictment against the applicant and fourteen other defendants, accusing them of membership of an illegal organisation. The prosecution requested that the applicant be convicted and sentenced pursuant to Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.\n\nOn 13 April 1993 the Ankara State Security Court, composed of three judges including a military judge, convicted the applicant as charged. The court held that there was sufficient and satisfactory evidence to disclose that he had committed the alleged offences. It accordingly sentenced him to three years\u2019 imprisonment. Both the applicant and the public prosecutor appealed.\n\nOn 8 February 1994 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first instance court on the ground that the applicant should have been convicted under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code on account of his membership to an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 16 March 1994 the Ankara State Security Court, to which the case had been remitted, held its first hearing and asked the accused persons to submit their final observations. On 27 May 1994 the applicant submitted his final observations and denied the charges against him. The court held thirty-three more hearings after this date, in search of one of the accused persons, who was on the run.\n\nOn 27 November 1997 the Ankara State Security Court applied the decision of the Court of Cassation and sentenced the applicant to twelve years and six months\u2019 imprisonment under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code\n\nOn 17 September 1998 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 22088/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Mehmet G\u00fcrova (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 6 May 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr E. Yurtalan, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 16 February 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Ankara.\n\nOn 17 May 2000 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation. The same day, the applicant was examined by a doctor, who reported that there was no sign of ill-treatment on his body. On 18 May 2000 he was questioned in police custody in the absence of a lawyer. In his police statement, the applicant admitted that he had had military training in Iran but rejected the allegation that he was a member of an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 21 May 2000 the applicant was again medically examined by a doctor, who stated that there were no traces of ill-treatment on his body. Subsequently, on the same day, the applicant was brought before the prosecutor and the investigating judge at the Ankara State Security Court, still in the absence of a lawyer. Before the public prosecutor, the applicant declared that he had been subjected to \u201cpsychological torture\u201d in police custody and refuted his police statement. He acknowledged that he had been to Iran but denied having had military training there. The applicant also gave a statement to the investigating judge. He retracted his police statement but did not mention any allegations of ill-treatment or duress. After the questioning was over, the investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody.\n\nOn 11 July 2000 the prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court filed an indictment with that court, charging the applicant with the offence of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the Tevhid-Selam and its sub-group the Kud\u00fcs Sava\u015f\u00e7\u0131lar\u0131. A number of other persons were also included in the same indictment and accused of various offences, such as the assassination of a number of prominent journalists and academics in Turkey. According to the prosecutor, the organisation's aim was to establish a religious regime in Turkey similar to that in Iran.\n\nOn 7 January 2002 the Ankara State Security Court rendered its 152 page-long judgment. The trial court found it established, on the basis of the applicant's police custody statement of 18 May 2000, that he was a member of the illegal organisation. It sentenced him to twelve years and six months' imprisonment under Article 168 of the Criminal Code. In its decision the trial court also examined the applicant's allegation of psychological pressure in police custody. Having regard to the two medical reports drawn up at the time of the applicant's arrest and his release from police custody, which stated that there were no marks of injury on the applicant's body, the court concluded that the applicant had retracted his police custody statement in order to avoid conviction.\n\nOn 12 November 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant's conviction. The applicant was released from prison on 10 June 2006.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 43452/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Tu\u011frul Akyaz\u0131c\u0131 (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 16 September 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. Akyaz\u0131c\u0131, a lawyer practising in Samsun. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 1 February 2007 the Court decided to give notice of the application. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, an anaesthesiologist, was born in 1968 and lives in Samsun.\n\nThe applicant was working at the Kars State Hospital when criminal proceedings were instigated against him for alleged involvement in the activities of an illegal organisation. He was accused together with other suspects of, inter alia, hanging posters and banners in various places in Ankara on behalf of that organisation. Throughout the proceedings the applicant maintained his innocence. In the meantime, Kars State Hospital suspended the applicant pending the criminal proceedings.\n\nOn 11 September 2001 the Ankara State Security Court, on the basis of the evidence contained in the case file, convicted the applicant under Article 7 \u00a7 1 of Law no. 3713 and sentenced him to two years and six months' imprisonment and to a fine. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn an unspecified date a written opinion of the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation dated 10 December 2001 was submitted to that court. This opinion was not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 27 March 2002 the Court of Cassation held a hearing and upheld the judgment of the first-instance court in respect of the applicant.\n\nThe applicant's request for a rectification of the Court of Cassation's judgment was dismissed by the principal public prosecutor at that court.\n\nThe applicant submitted that he had been released from prison in July 2003.\n\nBy an additional judgment dated 4 May 2004, the Ankara State Security Court, taking into account the amendment to the definition of \u201cterror acts\u201d under section 7 of Law no. 3713 pursuant to Law no. 4928, acquitted the applicant, who had not taken part in any violent activities, and nullified his conviction, together with all its consequences. This judgment became final on 11 May 2004.\n\nIn the meantime, on 28 February 2002, the Supreme Disciplinary Commission of the Ministry of Health decided to dismiss the applicant from the civil service. The applicant's objection to this decision was dismissed by the administrative court who noted, inter alia, that, according to the disciplinary investigation, the applicant had taken fifteen days leave from 2 June 2000 in pursuit of his illegal activities. The court also noted that the applicant's conviction had become final. This decision was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Administrative Court on 27 December 2005. In his observations the applicant submitted that, despite his acquittal, his request for a retrial had been rejected by the administrative court. However, he did not submit any court decisions.\n\nAccording to an attestation dated 10 September 2007 the applicant is currently employed at Atasam hospital in Samsun.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 74318/01) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by twelve Turkish nationals, Mr Resul Sadak, Mr Nihat Osal, Mr Mehmet \u00c7akar, Mr Rustem Bayar, Mr Tahir Kutlu, Mr Cengiz Bal\u0131k, Mr \u0130zzet Belge, Mr Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mr Mehmet Temelkuran, Mr Mehmet Nezir Ayan, Mr Yakup Uyar and Mr Erdal G\u00fcler (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 1 April 2001.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr T. El\u00e7i, a lawyer practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 3 November 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the applicants\u2019 right to be brought promptly before a judge. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nAt the time of the events giving rise to the application, Mr Resul Sadak was the provincial leader and the other applicants were members of the Peoples\u2019 Democracy Party (Halk\u0131n Demokrasi Partisi, hereinafter \u201cHADEP\u201d) in \u015e\u0131rnak, which was a province in the State of Emergency region.\n\nOn 23 September 2000 Resul Sadak, Nihat Osal, Mehmet \u00c7akar, Rustem Bayar, Tahir Kutlu, Cengiz Bal\u0131k, \u0130zzet Belge, Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mehmet Temelkuran, Mehmet Nezir Ayan and Yakup Uyar went to Batman in order to participate in the Batman Provincial Congress of HADEP in two cars belonging to Yakup Uyar and Erdal G\u00fcler. On their way back to \u015e\u0131rnak from Batman, they were stopped in D\u00fczova village, in Cizre, and arrested by gendarmerie officers.

On the same day, the \u015e\u0131rnak Magistrates\u2019 Court ordered that Resul Sadak, Nihat Osal, Mehmet \u00c7akar, Rustem Bayar, Tahir Kutlu, Cengiz Bal\u0131k, \u0130zzet Belge, Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mehmet Temelkuran, Mehmet Nezir Ayan and Erdal G\u00fcler be detained on remand and that Yakup Uyar be released.\n\nSubsequently, criminal proceedings were brought against the applicants on charges of aiding and abetting the PKK contrary to Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713, and illegal possession of firearms and explosives contrary to Article 264 \u00a7 5 of the Criminal Code and Article 13 \u00a7 2 of Law no. 6136.\n\nOn 12 December 2000 the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court ordered the applicants\u2019 release pending trial.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003 the applicants were acquitted of the charges against them.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 38414/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Umut Taner (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 2 October 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr K. Bilgi\u00e7, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that he did not receive a fair and public hearing, as he was not informed promptly of the accusation against him, he did not have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and that he was not allowed to defend himself in person or through a lawyer.\n\nOn 13 December 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nOn 30 May 2006 the Government filed observations on the admissibility and merits. On 19 October 2006 the President of the Third Section refused to include in the case file the applicant's observations in reply to Government's observations and his just satisfaction claims which were filed outside the time-limit (Rule 38 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1984 and lives in \u0130zmir.\n\nOn 26 June 2002 the applicant, together with a friend of his, quarrelled with a man in a park. The quarrel had turned into a fight and the applicant stabbed the man in his left leg. The police and the public prosecutor took the statements of the parties, including the applicant. The applicant denied having injured the man. Following their questioning, they were all released.\n\nOn 3 July 2002 the Public Prosecutor at the \u0130zmir Magistrates' Court filed an indictment against the applicant, on account of assault with a knife and occasioning actual bodily harm. The indictment was not notified to the applicant.\n\nAfter having examined the case file, on 17 July 2002 the \u0130zmir Magistrates' Court issued a penal order, convicting the applicant and sentencing him to pay 290,805,465 Turkish liras (TRL).\n\nOn 30 August 2002 the penal order was notified to the applicant.\n\nOn 6 September 2002 the applicant challenged the decision of the \u0130zmir Magistrate's Court, before the \u0130zmir Criminal Court of First Instance. He argued that he had been deprived of his right of defence in violation of Article 6 of the Convention.\n\nOn 11 September 2002 the \u0130zmir Criminal Court of First Instance upheld the decision of the Magistrate's Court, maintaining that it was in accordance with the law and procedure.\n\nOn 25 September 2002 the \u0130zmir Public Prosecutor issued a payment order under which the applicant was obliged to pay the relevant amount. He was warned that in case he failed to pay the due amount, the fine would be converted into prison sentence.\n\nThe applicant paid the relevant charge on 26 November 2002.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 28426/06) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Swedish national, Ms Sonja Mendel (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 28 June 2006.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr J. S\u00f6dergren, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mrs C. Hellner, of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that her right to access to a court according to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention had been violated since she had not been able to appeal to a court against a decision by an authority to withdraw permission for her to participate in a labour market policy programme. On the same ground, she argued that she had been denied the right to an effective remedy under Article 13 of the Convention.\n\nOn 12 December 2007 the President of the Third Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Malm\u00f6.\n\nSince 1992 the applicant has been registered with the Employment Service (Arbetsf\u00f6rmedlingen) in Malm\u00f6 and, since 2001, she has been taking part in different programmes provided by it. One of these programmes, called activity guarantee (aktivitetsgaranti), was a programme for persons who were, or who were at a risk of becoming, unemployed for a long period as well as for groups of persons who often had difficulties in finding a job. The purpose of the programme was to give the participants greater opportunities to find a job and it involved different activities such as short term education and the possibility to try different kinds of work. Each person who participated in the programme had a personal supervisor from the Employment Service and together they were supposed to set up a plan for the activities in which the participant was taking part. The participant was obliged to attend meetings and to meet his or her supervisor on a regular basis, and he or she also had an obligation to apply for suitable jobs which were advertised through the Employment Service.\n\nOn 4 July 2005 the Employment Service (apparently on delegation from the County Labour Board (L\u00e4nsarbetsn\u00e4mnden)) decided to withdraw its approval for the applicant to take part in the programme in which she was participating. The decision was taken in accordance with Section 37(a) of the Ordinance on Labour Market Policy Programmes (f\u00f6rordningen om arbetsmarknadspolitiska program, SFS 2000:634; hereafter \u201cthe 2000 Ordinance\u201c). According to the Employment Service, the applicant had not been acting in a proper manner in relation to the demands laid upon her. The decision was taken on the basis of a report drawn up by the Employment Service. The report stated that the applicant had been called to attend information meetings on several occasions but that she had either announced that she was not able to attend or she had simply not attended. It also stated that the applicant, at an information meeting, had made statements that led to a job interview being cancelled.\n\nWhen the applicant\u2019s permission to participate in the programme was revoked, her subsistence support in the form of activity support (see \u00a7 18 below) was also revoked, leaving her without any income. According to the applicant this forced her to pay for living expenses out of her savings for nine months and to take 25% early retirement in September 2005.\n\nOn 21 July 2005 the applicant appealed against the decision of the Employment Service to the National Labour Market Board (Arbetsmark-nadsstyrelsen \u2013hereafter \u201cthe Board\u201d). She claimed that there were several statements in the report which were not true. For instance, she had been ill and hospitalised and therefore had not been able to attend certain meetings and she had informed the Employment Service about the situation. She also alleged that a note in the report which stated that on one occasion she had not attended a meeting was not true. Moreover, she claimed that, at the aforementioned information meeting, she had told an official of the Employment Service that she felt she was not suited for the job in question. Thereafter, the official had told her that she could leave.\n\nOn 29 March 2006 the Board decided to reject the appeal. It found that the applicant had, on several occasions in August and September 2004, announced that she was not able to attend certain meetings; on one occasion because she had planned to go on vacation. The Board took into account the possibilities to adapt the kind of work the applicant was offered, and the fact that she had not proved her medical problems or shown that they were of a permanent nature, and found that she had not done everything in her power to get a job. Therefore, the Board concluded that there were grounds to withdraw her entitlement to participate in the programme. Consequently, the appeal was rejected.\n\nIn the Board\u2019s decision, it was expressly stated that there was no possibility in accordance with Section 39 of the 2000 Ordinance to appeal against the decision.\n\nOn 6 April 2006 the applicant wrote a letter to the Board, expressing her dissatisfaction with its decision. In the letter she referred, inter alia, to the fact that the Board in its decision had noted that no appeal lay against the decision and asked how she could obtain redress.\n\nOn 11 September 2006 the applicant submitted a complaint to the Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern) where she complained, inter alia, about the authorities\u2019 decisions and their handling of her case. She requested damages, but did not claim that there had been a breach of her rights under Article 6 of the Convention. This complaint seems still to be pending before the Chancellor of Justice.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 64212/01) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) on 4 June 1999 by a Polish national, Mr. M. Wojtunik (\u201cthe applicant\u201d).\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr. J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 28 October 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nA. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in \u015awinouj\u015bcie.\n\nOn 1 December 1992 the applicant brought an action against his former employer before the Szczecin Regional Court for payment of 88,674 zlotys in compensation for refraining from undertaking any professional activity in competition to that of his former employer. His contract of employment provided for such compensation for a period of six months after the termination of his contract of employment (\u201cthe competition clause\u201d).\n\nHearings were held on 3 March 1993, 27 August 1993 and 26 October 1993. On 26 October 1993 the Szczecin Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s action. The applicant appealed to the Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal.\n\nOn 24 March 1994 an appeal hearing was held.\n\nOn 5 May 1994 the Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal quashed the judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 20 December 1994 a hearing was held during which the court examined witnesses.\n\nOn 7 February 1995, 4 April 1995 and 16 May 1995 further hearings were held. On 16 May 1995 the court decided to have witnesses examined by other courts for reasons of economy of proceedings. It sent its request to these courts on 27 July 1995. On 12 October 1995 and 10 December 1995 the requested courts examined witnesses.\n\nOn 6 February 1996, 18 March 1996 and 19 November 1996 further hearings were held.\n\nOn 29 January 1997 the Szczecin Regional Court gave a judgment in which it allowed the applicant\u2019s claim in part \u2013 it awarded him 44,621 zlotys. Both parties appealed.\n\nOn 31 July 1997 the Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s action in its entirety. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal.\n\nOn 24 February 1998 the Supreme Court of Appeal quashed the judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 22 October 1998 a hearing was held before the Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal during which the parties agreed to enter into negotiations.\n\nOn 28 January 1999 a judicial settlement was concluded and the proceedings were discontinued. According to the settlement, the applicant obtained 61,000 zlotys.\n\nB. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE 0\n\nOn 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki - \u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings. A party to pending proceedings may ask for the acceleration of those proceedings and/or just satisfaction for their unreasonable length under section 2 read in conjunction with section 5(1) of the 2004 Act.\n\nOn 18 January 2005 the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) adopted a resolution (no. III SPP 113/04) in which it ruled that while the 2004 Law produced legal effects as from the date of entry into force (17 September 2004), its provisions applied retroactively to all proceedings in which delays had occurred before that date but only when they had not yet been remedied.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 1820/08) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Nigerian national, Mr Steven O. Omojudi (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 9 January 2008.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms N. Mole of the Aire Centre, a lawyer practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms H. Upton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nOn 25 November 2008 the President of the Chamber decided to give notice of the application to the Government of the United Kingdom. It was also decided to judge on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, Mr Steven O. Omojudi, is a Nigerian national who was born in 1960. He currently lives in Nigeria.\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.\n\nThe applicant was born in Nigeria and lived there until 1982. He was educated in Nigeria and for a period he was employed by a Nigerian aviation handling company. On 9 September 1982, when he was twenty-two years old, he was granted two months' leave to enter the United Kingdom as a student. His leave was subsequently extended to 15 January 1986. In 1983 the applicant was joined by his partner, who was also a national of Nigeria. The applicant married his partner in the United Kingdom in 1987. They had three children, who were born on 11 February 1986, 28 October 1991 and 16 September 1992. The children were born in the United Kingdom and all are British citizens. The oldest child has a daughter, who is now two years old.\n\nPrior to the expiry of his leave in January 1986, the applicant applied for a further extension. The following day, however, he was caught returning from the Netherlands with a British visitor's passport obtained by deception. Although he was not prosecuted for the offence, the application to extend his leave was refused.\n\nOn 12 March 1987 the applicant was informed of his liability for deportation. He was served with a deportation order on 31 July 1987. He attempted to appeal against the order and a second deportation order was served on 4 December 1990. The applicant appealed against the second order, but the appeal was subsequently withdrawn.\n\nThe applicant was convicted of theft and conspiracy to defraud on 7 March 1989. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Other convictions the same day resulted in five terms of twelve months' imprisonment to run concurrently.\n\nOn 24 October 1995 the applicant claimed asylum by post, but on 12 January 1998 the application was refused for non-compliance.\n\nOn 28 September 2000 the applicant and his wife applied for leave to remain under an overstayer's regularisation scheme. On 18 April 2005 they both were granted Indefinite Leave to Remain.\n\nOn 19 November 2006 the applicant was convicted of sexual assault. The conviction stemmed from an incident in which the applicant, in his capacity as a housing officer, touched a woman's breast without her consent. He was sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment, with half to be spent in custody and half on licence, and he was registered as a sex offender. The offence was considered to be particularly serious as the applicant was in a position of trust at the time it was committed. The sentencing judge described the offence as \u201ca gross sexual intrusion into the private life of a woman by someone in a position of trust\u201d. He reduced the sentence, however, to lessen the impact on the applicant's family and he did not recommend him for deportation.\n\nThe Secretary of State for the Home Department made a deportation order on 31 March 2007 on the basis that deportation was necessary for the prevention of disorder and crime and for the protection of health and morals. The applicant appealed against that decision but the appeal was dismissed on 25 July 2007. Although the judge accepted that the applicant had established a family life in the United Kingdom, and that deportation would interfere with that family life, he concluded that the measure was proportionate because the applicant remained a potential offender who posed a threat to society. The applicant sought permission to apply for judicial review, which was refused on 15 August 2007 and again on 28 November 2007.\n\nThe applicant subsequently was served with removal directions set for 23 January 2008. On 18 January 2008 he introduced his case with the Court and on 24 January 2008 the Court ordered that the case be notified urgently to the Government under Rule 40 of the Rules of Court. On the same day the applicant again sought permission to apply for judicial review. Permission was refused and on 25 April 2008 the appeal against this decision was dismissed at an oral hearing. The applicant was served with new removal directions and he was deported to Nigeria on 27 April 2008.\n\nFrom 24 January 2008 until 25 April 2008 both the applicant and his representative requested the applicant's risk-assessment report from the Probation Service, initially on a weekly basis and subsequently at regular intervals. The report, however, was only disclosed on 25 April 2008.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29545/95) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by an Irish national, Mr Francis William Devlin (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 30 November 1995.\n\nThe applicant was represented before the Court by Mr E. O\u2019Neill, solicitor to the Equality Commission, Belfast. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley.\n\nThe applicant complained of the circumstances in which his application for a post in the Northern Ireland Civil Service was rejected and his complaints of discrimination on grounds of religion blocked by a certificate issued under section 42 of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976. He invokes principally Article 6 of the Convention, as well as Articles 8, 9, 10, 13 and 14 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court.\n\nBy a decision of 11 April 2001, the Chamber declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations. The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 2 in fine).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nIn June 1991, the applicant applied for a position as an administrative assistant with the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the lowest grade in the non-industrial civil service. He passed a written test but was not invited for interview at that stage. In 1992, the applicant was invited for interview, and was informed on 15 September 1992 that he was being recommended for appointment \u201csubject to the satisfactory outcome of various pre-appointment enquiries\u201d. He was informed on 21 October 1992 that he had been unsuccessful. No reasons were given.\n\nThe applicant believed that the decision not to appoint him must have been taken on grounds of his religious beliefs \u2013 he is a Catholic and a member of an association known as the Irish National Foresters \u2013 and not for any legitimate security ground. A number of his relatives are involved in public service in various capacities, and neither he nor any member of his family had ever been involved in any form of criminal activity. He had some unpleasant encounters with the police, but there was no question of proceedings against him. On one occasion, the applicant lodged a complaint about his treatment by the police, which was resolved when the applicant was informed that the officers involved would be \u201cspoken to\u201d. According to the applicant, a further incident with the police occurred about a week after he was informed that his job application had been unsuccessful: a police officer at a vehicle checkpoint in Cookstown referred to the unsuccessful job application.\n\nThe applicant made an application, through the Fair Employment Commission, to the Fair Employment Tribunal, alleging discrimination contrary to the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 (\u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d). The Northern Ireland Civil Service affirmed that the refusal had been made on security grounds, and claimed that the 1976 Act did not therefore apply.\n\nOn 21 September 1993, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland issued a certificate under section 42 (2) of the 1976 Act, certifying that the refusal of employment to the applicant was an act \u201cdone for the purpose of safeguarding national security and of protecting public safety\u201d.\n\nThe applicant attempted to challenge the Secretary of State\u2019s decision to issue the section 42 certificate by way of an application for judicial review in the High Court. Leave to apply for judicial review was granted on 4 January 1994.\n\nIn the affidavits sworn on behalf of the Secretary of State, it was stated that, in accordance with the usual procedure, the security questionnaire completed by the applicant had been forwarded to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (\u201cthe RUC\u201d), which had provided security information relating to the applicant. This information was such that the assessing officer in the Department\u2019s security branch had recommended that the applicant was unsuitable for employment in the Northern Ireland Civil Service.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful application for discovery, the application for judicial review was dismissed by Mr Justice Kerr in the High Court on 6 September 1995. After referring, inter alia, to the judgment of Mr Justice McCollum of 3 December 1991 in the case of Tinnelly and Sons Limited and Others and McElduff and Others (judgment of 10 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV, p. 1633), he considered that: \u201cthe effect of section 42 (1) as enacted is to remove entirely from the sphere of Fair Employment legislation acts done for the purpose of safeguarding national security and protecting public order or safety. ... [There] may be occasions when the Secretary of State will choose not to invoke his powers under section 42 (2) and the Tribunal may investigate whether the act complained of was done for all or any of the purposes specified under Section 42 (1). Where a certificate has been validly issued under Section 42 (2), however, I do not believe that the Tribunal retains any role in the hearing or adjudication of the complaint.\u201d",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in two applications (nos. 29537/95 and 35453/97) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Zbigniew Radaj, (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 16 February 1994 and 4 October 1996 respectively.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Krzysztof Drzewicki of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his correspondence with the Convention organs was, while he was detained on remand, twice intercepted, opened and read by the prison authorities and by the court before which the criminal proceedings against him were pending.\n\nThe applications were transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe applications were allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1. On 14 October 1999 the Court decided to join the applications.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.\n\nBy a decision of 21 March 2002 the Court declared the applications partly admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant is a Polish national, who was born in 1953 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nTwo letters from the Secretariat of the European Commission of Human Rights, posted on 20 March 1996 and on 14 May 1996, were intercepted, opened and read by the administration of the Warszawa-S\u0142u\u017cewiec prison, where the applicant was detained on remand. They were subsequently forwarded to the Warsaw District Court, before which criminal proceedings against the applicant were pending at that time, and were read by the court.\n\nOn 29 April 1996 the applicant requested the President of the Warsaw District Court to explain what was the legal basis on which his correspondence with the European Commission of Human Rights had been opened and read.\n\nHe reiterated his complaint on 31 July 1996 in a letter to the President of the Regional Court. In reply, on 15 October 1996 the President of the Regional Court informed him that Article 8 of the Convention did not prohibit censorship of correspondence of persons detained on remand. It was also permitted under Section 33 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Detention on Remand. The correspondence sent to the European Commission of Human Rights fell within the scope of this provision. It was further stated that the text of the Convention did not contain provisions relating to the inviolability of the correspondence to and from the European Commission of Human Rights.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 18404/91) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Cypriot national, Mr Loukas Nicola (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 31 May 1991.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr L. Clerides, a lawyer practising in Nicosia. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z.M. Necatigil.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus had deprived him of his home and properties.\n\nThe applicant died on 25 May 1992. On 27 July 1999 his son, Mr Andreas Luca Nicolaides, who had become the administrator of his estate, informed the Court that he wished to pursue the application on behalf of the deceased. This intention was confirmed on 26 January 2008.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nBy a decision of 8 June 1999 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). In addition, third-party comments were received from the Government of Cyprus, which had exercised its right to intervene (Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 \u00a7 1 (b)).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1904 and lives in Nicosia.\n\nThe applicant claimed that until 1974 he had lived with his family (composed of his wife, two of his sons, his married daughter, her husband and her two children) in a house which belonged to him in Trypimeni, a village in the District of Famagusta.\n\nThe applicant produced a copy of the original title deed, dated 3 February 1936. According to this document, the house at issue originally consisted of two rooms at ground level, one room on the upper floor, two verandas, one stable, one village oven and a yard with trees. It was registered under registration number 5299, sheet/plan 13/40, plot no. 165. The area of the applicant\u2019s land was 377 sq. m. According to an affidavit signed by the applicant\u2019s son, three additional rooms (one downstairs and one upstairs) had been built prior to July 1974. The house had an overall inside area of approximately 200 sq. m.\n\nIn July 1974, according to the applicant, he had been forced to leave Famagusta and flee to the area still controlled by the Cypriot Government.\n\nSince 1974 the applicant had been unable to return to his home and property in the northern part of Cyprus. On 9 December 1990 he took part in a car convoy organised by persons from three villages in Kyrenia and from Trypimeni wishing to return to their homes in the north peacefully. The participants in the convoy had informed the commander of the United Nations (UN) forces in Cyprus of their intention to return home. They drove to the \u201cbuffer zone\u201d checkpoint on the main road linking Nicosia and Famagusta. There they stopped and asked the UN officer on duty to be allowed to return to their homes, property and villages. They requested him to transmit their demand to the Turkish military authorities. The UN officer announced to the applicant and the other participants in the convoy that their request to drive through the checkpoint and enter the northern part of Cyprus had been refused by the Turkish military authorities.\n\nThe applicant alleged that his house in Trypimeni had been used by the Turkish army. The Government disputed this allegation.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 38190/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Wojciech Figiel (\u201cthe applicant\u201d) on 29 January 2005.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 1 September 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nThe Government requested that the present application be joined to application no. 38206/05, which was lodged by the applicant (Figiel v. Poland (no. 2)) and which concerned the length of another and unrelated set of civil proceedings. On 6 May 2008 the President of the Chamber decided not to join the applications.\n\nThe Government submitted a unilateral declaration and invited the Court to strike both of the above-mentioned applications out of the list, in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Warsaw.\n\nA. Civil proceedings for payment\n\nOn 25 October 1999 the applicant lodged a civil claim for payment with the Warsaw District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy). The applicant requested the court to make an order for payment against his business partner. The value of the claim was 500 zlotys (PLN) (about 150 euros (EUR)). Between 25 October 1999 and 27 October 2004 the court held seven hearings, three of which were postponed for various reasons. At the hearing on 27 October 2004 the parties concluded a friendly settlement. On the same day the Warsaw District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) discontinued the proceedings.\n\nB. Proceedings under the 2004 Act\n\nOn 21 September 2004 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d). He sought a ruling that the length of the proceedings before the Warsaw District Court had been excessive and an award of just satisfaction. On 19 October 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court gave a decision in which it acknowledged the excessive length of the proceedings (35 months and 21 days of inactivity on the part of the Warsaw District Court) but refused to grant the applicant any just satisfaction, holding that the applicant had failed to reason his request for just satisfaction and that the proceedings for payment of PLN 500 \u201cwere not particularly important for the applicant who is an entrepreneur, because the consequences are not attributable to the excessive length of the proceedings\u201d.\n\nC. Application no. 38206/05\n\nOn 29 January 2005 the applicant lodged another application concerning the length of a different set of civil proceedings for payment. These proceedings lasted 5 years and 22 days at two court instances. The applicant made use of the complaint provided for by the 2004 Act and the domestic court acknowledged the excessive length of proceedings (36 months and 7 days of inactivity on the part of the Warsaw District Court) but refused to grant the applicant any just satisfaction.",

The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 20 May 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the lawfulness and length of the applicant\u2019s detention and the absence of an investigation into his detention. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Izmir.\n\nWhile the applicant was in compulsory military service in K\u0131rklareli, on 19 November 2002 he got ten days\u2019 leave and went to Izmir to see his family. He did not return to his barracks afterwards.\n\nOn 22 February 2003 at 3 p.m., the applicant was arrested by police officers at the Narl\u0131dere police station during a routine identity check on suspicion of being an army deserter (asker ka\u00e7a\u011f\u0131). At 4 p.m. he was taken to the \u00dc\u00e7kuyular Military Station Command where the officials determined that he had not returned to his army command when his leave had ended. He was questioned, inter alia, about which army command he belonged to, why he had deserted and whether he had committed a crime during this time.\n\nOn the same day at 8 p.m., the applicant was taken to \u015eirinyer Military Station Command where he remained in custody. The next day at 11 a.m., he was transferred to the Military Recruitment Office.\n\nOn 7 March 2003 at 1.30 p.m., the applicant was transferred to his army command in K\u0131rklareli. The verbatim record of this transfer noted that the applicant, having committed the offence of army desertion, was requested to be transferred to his army command. It further indicated that the applicant had entered the \u201csecurity room\u201d on 23 February 2003 and \u201cexited\u201d on 6 March 2003.\n\nOn the same day at 2 p.m., the applicant was questioned by two army officials who informed him that he had committed the offence of exceeding his leave.\n\nBetween 7 March and 11 March 2003, the applicant was held in custody at his army command.\n\nOn 11 March 2003 he was brought before the \u00c7orlu Military Court, which remanded him in custody.\n\nOn 12 March 2003 the \u00c7orlu Military Prosecutor filed an indictment charging the applicant with exceeding his leave (\u201cizin tecav\u00fcz\u00fc\u201d) under Article 66 \u00a7 1 of the Military Criminal Code.\n\nOn 14 April 2003 the \u00c7orlu Military Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to ten months\u2019 imprisonment. In its decision the court noted that the applicant had failed to return to his army command at the end of his leave, that he had been apprehended on 22 February 2003 and that he had been held in custody between 7 and 11 March. It deducted the period spent on the road and in custody between 22 February and 11 March 2003 from his prison sentence.\n\nOn 22 April 2003 the judgment of the \u00c7orlu Military Court became final as neither the military prosecutor nor the applicant appealed.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 39958/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Dariusz Pi\u0105tkiewicz (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 14 June 2000.\n\nThe Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 1 September 2006 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1949 and lives in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\n\n1. Main proceedings - civil proceedings for payment\n\nOn 22 May 1991 the applicant filed a claim for payment against his former employer with the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki). On 2 December 1991 the court gave judgment. Upon the applicant's appeal the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacjny) remitted the case on 22 April 1992.\n\nOn 19 August 1993 the Regional Court held the first hearing in the case. Subsequently, hearings were held on 19 October 1993, 10 March and 26 April 1994.\n\nIn 1995 the court held two hearings, on 14 February and 13 June, and ordered the preparation of an expert opinion.\n\nOn 15 March 1996 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court gave a preliminary judgment.\n\nOn 14 August 1996 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal quashed the judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 16 June and 14 October 1997 the Regional Court held further hearings. On 28 October 1997 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court gave judgment.

On 10 May 2005 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal rejected the appeal as it was inadmissible in law.\n\nOn 13 June 2005 the applicant lodged a claim for damages under section 16 of the 2004 Act read in conjunction with Article 417 of the Civil Code. He sought compensation for the alleged mistakes in the examination of his claims and for the protracted length of the proceedings. On 30 September 2005 the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court dismissed the claim. His appeal against the judgment was dismissed by the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Court of Appeal on 18 May 2006. The applicant submitted that he had not lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court. The Government maintained that such an appeal was pending before the Supreme Court.\n\n3. Proceedings for reinstatement\n\nIn his letter of 30 March 2003 the applicant submitted additional complaints about another set of civil proceedings for reinstatement.\n\nOn 29 June 1999 the applicant appealed to the Olsztyn District Court against a decision to dismiss him from work.\n\nOn 19 October 2000 the Olsztyn District Court gave judgment. On 15 January 2001 the Olsztyn Regional Court upheld the first-instance judgment. The applicant filed a cassation appeal. On 27 February 2002 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's cassation appeal for failure to comply with procedural requirements.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 59645/00) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by nine Turkish nationals, Mr Abdulaziz Ak\u0131nt\u0131, Mr Kemal Ya\u011f\u0131\u015f, Mr Mahmut D\u00fczg\u00fcn, Mr Adnan Kaya, Mr Mecit Ayg\u00fcn, Mr H\u00fcseyin Y\u00fcce, Mr \u0130mrah Akyaz, Mrs Suna Bayrak and Mr Abdullah Ba\u011fr\u0131yan\u0131k (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 6 June 2000.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mrs F. Karaka\u015f Do\u011fan, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 6 February 2003 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the applicants' right to a fair trial to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants (see paragraph 1 above) were born in 1961, 1953, 1954, 1962, 1960, 1967, 1956, 1971 and 1965 respectively and live in Istanbul. Mecit Ayg\u00fcn was the chairman and the other applicants were the members of district administrative board of the Peoples' Democracy Party (Halk\u0131n Demokrasi Partisi, hereinafter \u201cHADEP\u201d) in Gaziosmanpa\u015fa, a district of Istanbul.\n\nOn 3 February 1998 police officers from the anti-terror branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate conducted a search at the Gaziosmanpa\u015fa district office of the HADEP, where they found illegal publications.\n\nSubsequently, the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court initiated an investigation against the applicants.\n\nOn 25 March 1998 the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment charging the applicants with aiding and abetting the PKK under Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713 alleging that the publications found in the HADEP district office contained articles supporting the activities of the PKK. He further issued a decision of non\u2011jurisdiction in respect of the charge concerning possession of illegal publications and referred the case to the Istanbul public prosecutor's office.\n\nAt the hearing of 6 November 1998 the public prosecutor's submissions on the merits of the case were read out. The submissions of the public prosecutor were not served on the applicants.\n\nOn the same day, the Istanbul State Security Court convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced them to three years and nine months' imprisonment.\n\nOn 10 November 1998 the applicants appealed against the judgment of 6 November 1998.\n\nOn 18 October 1999 the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his opinion on the merits of the applicants' appeal to the Court of Cassation. This opinion was not served on the applicants or their representative.\n\nOn 6 March 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the first-instance court's judgment.\n\nOn 23 March 2000 the applicants applied to the public prosecutor's office at the Court of Cassation requesting this office to bring the case before the Court of Cassation for rectification of decision. On 25 April 2000 their request was dismissed.\n\nSubsequent to their convictions, on an unspecified date, the applicants were detained.\n\nOn 21 December 2000 Law No. 4616 on Conditional Release, Deferral of Procedure and Punishments was promulgated\n\nOn different dates in February 2001, the Istanbul State Security Court ordered the applicants' conditional release pursuant to Law no. 4616.\n\nMeanwhile, on 5 July 2000 the Istanbul Magistrates' Court acquitted the applicants of the charge concerning possession of illegal publications.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 8713/03) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Antoni Janus (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 10 February 2003.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Jakub Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his detention on remand exceeded a \u201creasonable time\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn 25 June 2008 the President of the Fourth Section Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nOn 6 January 2008 the applicant\u2019s mother, Mrs Stefania Janus, informed the Court\u2019s Registry that the applicant had died on 29 November 2008. She stated that she wished to continue the proceedings before the Court in her late son\u2019s stead.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1954 and lived in Czarne, Poland.\n\n1. Criminal proceedings against the applicant and his detention pending trial\n\nThe applicant was arrested by the police on 12 September 2001 on a charge of murder and by a decision of the Byt\u00f3w District Court of 14 September 2001 he was detained on remand.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was prolonged on several occasions by the S\u0142upsk Regional Court (decisions of 6 December 2001, 2 January 2002, 22 March 2002, 20 December 2002, 18 March 2003 and 16 June 2003).\n\nThe applicant on several occasions unsuccessfully applied to be released and to have the preventive measure imposed on him changed into a more lenient one.\n\nThe courts justified their decisions prolonging the applicant\u2019s detention on remand and their refusals to release him by the existence of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence concerned and by the severity of the anticipated sentence.\n\nOn 22 March 2002 the S\u0142upsk Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to eight years\u2019 imprisonment. On 5 September 2002 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the lower court.\n\nOn 16 September 2003 the S\u0142upsk Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. On 10 February 2004 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the lower court.\n\nOn 7 February 2005 the S\u0142upsk Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. On 23 June 2005 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to six years\u2019 imprisonment. A cassation appeal against the second-instance judgment was available.\n\nOn 23 June 2005 the applicant was released because of his health which had prevented him from serving a term of imprisonment. The applicant submitted that from August 2005 he had been examined several times by psychiatrists and that he had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for short periods on five occasions. He had been diagnosed with nervous depression.\n\n2. Censorship of the applicant\u2019s correspondence\n\nOn 5 March 2003 the Court received a letter from the applicant dated 9 February 2003. The envelope bore the following stamps: \u201cthe S\u0142upsk Regional Court (...)\u201d and \u201cCensored on 18 February\u201d (Ocenzurowano dnia 18.02) and an illegible signature.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31246/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Piotr Osuch (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 29 July 2002.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 18 October 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the excessive length of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nOn 10 March 1999 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of robbery and extortion. He was also suspected of being a member of an organised criminal group.\n\nOn 12 March 1999 the Warsaw District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be detained until 9 June 1999. The court found that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question.\n\nOn 1 June 1999 the District Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention. It referred to the interests of the pending investigation, such as the need to obtain additional evidence. The court also considered that the applicant, if released, could induce witnesses to give false testimony.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s detention was subsequently prolonged several times by the District Court for the same reasons as before.\n\nOn 27 August 1999 the Warsaw Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okr\u0119gowy) lodged with the Warsaw District Court a bill of indictment against the applicant and six other persons. They were indicted of several counts of robbery, extortion, and membership of an organised criminal group.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s detention was subsequently extended by the Warsaw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) on 6 March, 26 June, 28 September and 30 November 2001. The court considered that keeping the applicant in custody was justified by the existence of strong evidence against him and the gravity of the charges. It was also necessary as he could obstruct the proper course of the proceedings or induce witnesses to give false testimony. The applicant\u2019s appeals against those decisions were dismissed.\n\nOn 16 January 2002 the Warsaw District Court convicted the applicant of several counts of robbery and extortion committed in an organised criminal group. The applicant was sentenced to 9 years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe Warsaw Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) upheld the first-instance judgment on 6 February 2003.\n\nOn 28 October 2003 the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) dismissed the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 32008/05) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Etem Karag\u00f6z (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 18 August 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr S. G\u00fczel, a lawyer practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 27 June 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29\u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Diyarbak\u0131r.\n\nOn 19 January 1994 the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody by officers of the Diyarbak\u0131r security police in connection with an investigation into an illegal organisation.\n\nOn 7 February 1994 the applicant was brought before the Diyarbak\u0131r public prosecutor and then the investigating judge, who remanded the applicant in custody.\n\nBy an indictment dated 17 March 1994, the public prosecutor at the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and a number of others, accusing him, inter alia, of carrying out activities for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory under Article 125 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 30 July 1997 the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court convicted and sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment, pursuant to Article 125 of the Criminal Code.\n\nThe applicant appealed. On 1 March 1999 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on procedural grounds and remitted the case to the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court. Following constitutional amendments introduced on 7 May 2004, the State Security Courts were totally abolished. Subsequently, the applicant\u2019s case was resumed before the 6th Assize Court of Diyarbak\u0131r.\n\nThroughout the whole proceedings the applicant regularly requested his release whereas the trial courts rejected his requests. On 20 October 2005 the applicant noted that he had already been detained for a period of more than eleven years and reiterated his request. Relying on the accusations against the applicant, the existence of strong evidence against him and the content of the case file, the 6th Assize Court of Diyarbak\u0131r refused his request again. The applicant appealed. On 25 October 2005 the 4th Assize Court of Diyarbak\u0131r dismissed the appeal without further reasoning.\n\nOn 9 March 2007 the 6th Assize Court of Diyarbak\u0131r convicted the applicant and sentenced him to life imprisonment. On 7 March 2008 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 44362/04) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two British nationals, Kirk and Lorraine Dickson (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 23 November 2004.\n\nThe applicants, who were granted legal aid, were represented by Mr E. Abrahamson, a lawyer practising in Liverpool. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Grainger, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nOn 8 March 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1972 and 1958, respectively. The first applicant is in prison (Dovergate Prison, Uttoxeter) and the second applicant lives in Hull.\n\nIn 1994 the first applicant was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a tariff of 15 years. He is imprisoned in a private prison and his earliest expected release date is 2009. He has no children.\n\nIn 1999 he met the second applicant, while she was also imprisoned, by correspondence through a prison pen pal network. She has since been released, although it is not clear when. In 2001 the applicants married. The second applicant already had three children from other relationships.\n\nSince the applicants wished to have a child, in October 2001 the first applicant applied for facilities for artificial insemination. In December 2002 the second applicant joined this application. Their solicitors made representations to the Secretary of State, relying on the length of the relationship and the fact that, given the first applicant\u2019s earliest release date and the second applicant\u2019s age, it was unlikely that the applicants would be able to have a child together without the use of artificial insemination facilities.\n\nIn a letter dated 28 May 2003 the Secretary of State refused their application. He first set out his general policy (\u201cthe policy\u201d): \u201cRequests for artificial insemination by prisoners are carefully considered on individual merit and will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. In reaching decisions particular attention is given to the following general considerations:\n\nwhether the provision of AI facilities is the only means by which conception is likely to occur\n\nwhether the prisoner\u2019s expected day of release is neither so near that delay would not be excessive nor so distant that he/she would be unable to assume the responsibilities of a parent\n\nwhether both parties want the procedure and the medical authorities both inside and outside the prison are satisfied that the couple are medically fit to proceed with AI\n\nwhether the couple were in a well established and stable relationship prior to imprisonment which is likely to subsist after the prisoner\u2019s release\n\nwhether there is any evidence to suggest that the couple\u2019s domestic circumstances and the arrangements for the welfare of the child are satisfactory, including the length of time for which the child might expect to be without a father or mother\n\nwhether having regard to the prisoner\u2019s history, antecedents and other relevant factors there is evidence to suggest that it would not be in the public interest to provide artificial insemination facilities in a particular case.\u201d He then gave his reasons for refusal in the present case. On the one hand, the second applicant would be 51 years old at the earliest possible date of release of the first applicant so that the likelihood of her being able to conceive naturally was small. Both applicants were also in full agreement about their wish to conceive artificially. However, on the other hand, and in the first place, the relationship was established while they were in prison and had not been tested in the normal environment of daily life. Secondly, there was insufficient provision in place to provide independently for the material welfare of any child which might be conceived. Thirdly, there was little in the way of an immediate support network in place for the mother and any child which might be conceived. Fourthly, any child would be without a father for an important part of its childhood years. Fifthly, in light of the violence of the first applicant\u2019s crime, there would be legitimate public concern that the punitive and deterrent elements of his sentence of imprisonment were being circumvented if he were allowed to father a child by artificial insemination.\n\nThe applicants sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of State\u2019s decision. On 29 July 2003 the High Court refused leave on the papers. The applicants renewed their application and on 5 September 2003 leave was again refused after an oral hearing. On 13 October 2003 the applicants introduced an application to this Court and it was declared inadmissible in December 2003 on the basis that they had failed to exhaust domestic remedies (App. No. 34127/03). The applicants then applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal.\n\nOn 30 September 2004 their application was unanimously rejected by the Court of Appeal. Auld LJ relied in principle on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R (Mellor) v Secretary of State for the Home Department ([2001] 3 WLR 533). He pointed to the similarity of the arguments put by the applicants in the present case and in the Mellor case. Auld LJ relied on the conclusion of Lord Phillips in the Mellor case (see \u201cRelevant Domestic Law and Practice\u201d below) and commented: \u201c... Lord Phillips clearly had in mind, and he set it out in the course of his judgment, the provisions of Article 8.2 of the Convention setting out various matters that may justify interference with the right to respect for private and family life, including the protection of health or morals and the protection of the rights and freedom of others. It seems to me that concern, not only for the public attitude to the exercise by prisoners of certain rights in prison which they would take for granted outside, and concern for the rights of a putative child in the upbringing it would receive depending on the circumstances and the length of the imprisonment involved, are highly relevant circumstances for the purposes of Article 8.2... Accordingly, in my view, it is not open to [the applicants] to seek to re-open the validity of the Secretary of State\u2019s policy which this court has held in Mellor is rational and otherwise lawful. As Lord Phillips made clear in his judgment in that case, although the starting point of the policy is that deprivation of facilities for artificial insemination may prevent conception altogether, the finishing point is whether there are exceptional circumstances for not applying the policy ...\u201d He then noted that on occasions the Secretary of State had \u201cdis-applied the policy\u201d when the circumstances had merited it: he referred to a letter from the Treasury Solicitor to the applicants which apparently demonstrated this fact and pointed out that counsel for the Secretary of State had informed the court that there had been other such instances.\n\nAuld LJ then applied the policy to the present case: \u201cTo the extent that [the applicants have] suggested that he Secretary of State has irrationally misapplied his own policy to the circumstances, or has otherwise acted disproportionately in applying it, I would reject the suggestion. There is no basis for saying that the Secretary of State\u2019s approach can be equated, as [the applicants] suggested, with the extinction of a fundamental right. It was a weighing of the starting point of the policy against the other considerations for which the policy itself provided, an exercise of discretion and proportionality in respect of which, in my view, the Secretary of State cannot be faulted on the circumstances as presented to him.\u201d\n\nThe other judges also relied on the judgment in Mellor. Mance LJ said the following: \u201cThe case of Mellor is also clear authority that considerations and potential consequences of public interest over and above a narrow view of the requirements of good order and security in prison can play a role in a decision whether or not to permit such artificial insemination... I note that, in addition to the European authorities specifically mentioned in paragraph 42 by Lord Phillips, the Commission, in its decision in Draper v the United Kingdom App No. 8186/78 at paragraphs 61 to 62, also recognised the potential relevance of more general considerations of public interest.\u201d",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 4064/03) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Stanis\u0142aw Opa\u0142ko (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 22 January 2003.\n\nThe Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 19 March 2007 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. The President also gave priority to the application, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.\n\nOn 10 December 2007 at 5.35 p.m. the Government sent a facsimile to the Court informing it that they were ready to settle the case. However, having regard to the fact that it was considering a draft of a judgment in the case at that stage, the Court decided to treat the Government's initiative as belated and to proceed with its deliberations.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1935 and lives in Komorowice.\n\nIn 1986 the applicant was arrested and detained on remand on a charge of stealing 4 tons of coal. The subsequent criminal proceedings against him ended in 1991, when he was finally acquitted.\n\nOn 22 January 1992 the applicant lodged with the Wroc\u0142aw Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki) an action for compensation for unlawful detention in 1986.\n\nOn 22 August 1994 the court held the first hearing, which was however adjourned.\n\nAt the second hearing held on 31 August 1995 the court dismissed the applicant's action.\n\nOn 7 September 1995 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision. However, the case file was transferred to the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) only on 21 May 1999.\n\nOn 14 July 1999 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.\n\nAugust 1999 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy).\n\nOn 6 February 2002 the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed both judgments and remitted the case to the Regional Court.\n\nThe Wroc\u0142aw Regional Court held the first hearing on 24 September 2002. Subsequently, on seven occasions, the composition of the court changed so the proceedings had to start from the beginning.\n\nOn 16 March 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d).\n\nOn 29 April 2005 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal allowed the complaint and granted the applicant PLN 2,000 in compensation (approximately EUR 514). The court analysed the course of the impugned proceedings in the light of the criteria which the Court itself applies and concluded that the Regional Court had violated the applicant's right to a hearing without unjustified delay.\n\nOn 14 October 2005 the Wroc\u0142aw Regional Court gave judgment. The court allowed the applicant's action and granted him PLN 27,000 in compensation for his unlawful detention in 1986. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 19 April 2006 the Wroc\u0142aw Court of Appeal upheld the judgment.\n\nThe applicant did not lodge a cassation appeal and the judgment became final.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 37252/05) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Seydo Kalg\u0131 (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 28 September 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M. G\u00fczeler, a lawyer practising in \u015eanl\u0131urfa. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 7 July 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1938 and lives in \u015eanl\u0131urfa.\n\nIn the cadastral survey carried out in 1964 some plots of land in Siverek village were registered in the names of the applicant and a number of other individuals. In 1971 an individual further donated his share of a plot in the same village to the applicant.\n\nOn 28 August 1972 two villagers (O.T., H.Y.) instituted civil proceedings against another villager (M.E.) objecting to the cadastral registrations and claiming that they were the lawful owners of the land in question on the basis of a registration dating from before 1950. It appears that on unspecified dates during the course of the proceedings numerous villagers, including the applicant, became parties to the proceedings, which continued with three complainants, seventeen defendants and two intervening third parties. Both the claimants and defendants claimed to have title to the land in question.\n\nOn 9 June 1983 the trial court requested the applicant's address to be determined so that he could be summoned before the court. On 20 March 1985 the trial court decided to publish the summons in a country-wide newspaper in an attempt to determine the applicant's whereabouts.\n\nOn 18 November 1985 H.Y. submitted a letter to the trial court informing the judge of an agreement he had reached with the applicant and stating that the applicant would appear before the court to testify accordingly.\n\nThe case file indicates that the applicant did not appear before the trial court until 22 March 2004, when he presented himself as one of the parties. On 22 November 2004 the applicant's representative submitted a power of attorney to the trial court.\n\nDuring the course of the proceedings the court held an on-site inspection on 23 June 1986. A number of expert reports were requested concerning the title registrations. Numerous witnesses were heard on various occasions. Some of the defendants transferred part of their shares to others on different dates.\n\nOn 5 March 2007 the Siverek Cadastral Court delivered its judgment in favour of the applicant and the other defendants. It appears that the number of claimants and defendants had reached twenty-eight and eighty-one respectively by the time the judgment was delivered.\n\nThe case is still pending before the Court of Cassation.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 39712/05) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Janusz Dudek (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 29 October 2005.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 14 January 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Cz\u0119stochowa.\n\nOn 23 October 2003 the applicant, who is a police officer, was charged with abuse of powers.\n\nOn 4 November 2003 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 5 November 2003 the applicant was released. The Krak\u00f3w Appeal Prosecutor (Prokuratura Apelacyjna) suspended the applicant from professional duties and ordered that he be subjected to police supervision in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question. It further referred to the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation.\n\nOn 20 November 2003 the applicant lodged an application with the prosecutor, requesting access to the investigation file. On 28 November 2003 the prosecutor dismissed the application. He referred to the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation.\n\nIn the meantime, on 22 November 2003, the applicant had lodged an application for his suspension from professional duties to be lifted or replaced by another preventive measure. The application was dismissed by the Prosecutor of Appeal. In his decision the prosecutor referred to the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation and the seriousness of the offences the applicant was charged with.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings, on 4 March and 2 June 2004, 14 March 2005 and 28 April 2006, the applicant made unsuccessful applications for his suspension from professional duties to be lifted or replaced by another preventive measure and he appealed, likewise unsuccessfully, against decisions dismissing his applications. In his applications he referred to the poor financial situation of his family resulting from the lengthy application of the preventive measure.\n\nOn 4 April 2006 the Krak\u00f3w Appeal Prosecutor decided to obtain a psychiatric report on the applicant and his ability to stand trial.\n\nOn 3 September 2007 the applicant lodged an application for his suspension from professional duties to be lifted or replaced by another preventive measure. On 2 October 2007 the Krak\u00f3w Prosecutor of Appeal lifted the preventive measure.\n\nIn the course of the investigation the proceedings were severed on several occasions and of the 110 suspects in this case 75 were indicted. However, the investigation concerning the remaining suspects, including the applicant, has not yet been completed.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 39197/98) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a United Kingdom national, Patrick Grattan Foley (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 12 August 1997.\n\nThe United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley, Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that civil proceedings brought by him were not determined within a reasonable time.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was originally allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court), which, on 11 September 2001, declared the application partially admissible and decided to dispense with a hearing (Rule 59 \u00a7 2 in fine).\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1924 and lives in Stratford-on-Avon.\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nThe applicant was an inventor and entered into an agreement with Ferranti plc whereby the latter would have exclusive rights to develop, design, manufacture and sell gaming machines based on the applicant\u2019s ideas. The applicant also set up a company (\u201cTransworld\u201d) which entered into an agreement with Ferranti Instrumentation Limited relating to the marketing of the machines. The venture was not a commercial success and in June 1982 the agreements were repudiated by the respective Ferranti companies.\n\nOn 4 July 1984 the applicant issued a writ in his own name and in that of Transworld (together, \u201cthe plaintiffs\u201d) against the two Ferranti companies (together, \u201cthe defendants\u201d). It was served on 5 July 1984. The defendants were granted one extension of time for service of the Defence with the plaintiffs\u2019 consent and then applied to the court for a further extension. On 3 October 1984, before that application could be heard, judgment in default of defence was entered for the plaintiffs. That judgment was set aside on 12 December 1984 and the Defence was served on 20 December 1984. The defendants served a request for Further and Better Particulars of the plaintiffs\u2019 Statement of Claim on the same date. The plaintiffs failed to reply within the fourteen-day deadline, leading the defendants to apply to the court which, on 21 March 1985, ordered that the plaintiffs reply within 42 days.\n\nThe defendants applied for security for their costs, and the court granted the application on 26 September 1985 by ordering the plaintiffs to pay a sum reflecting the defendants\u2019 likely costs up until the date for exchange of evidence. The proceedings were stayed until the security was paid.\n\nOn 3 October 1985 the plaintiffs appealed against the order. A hearing was listed for later that month but was postponed, according to the applicant due to a series of errors by the court registry.\n\nThe appeal was dismissed on 31 January 1986 and the plaintiffs paid the security on 28 February 1986.\n\nOn 2 August 1985 the plaintiffs served a request for Further and Better Particulars of the Defence. On 8 July 1986, once the stay imposed in September 1985 had been lifted by payment of the security, an order was made by consent of the parties.\n\nOn 21 May 1987 the defendants applied for an order that the plaintiffs fulfil their discovery obligations by serving a list of documents. The deadline for service of the list had expired on 3 January 1985. The order was made on 30 June 1987.\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 solicitors filed a Notice of Intention to Proceed on 5 January 1989 as required by the rules of court since no steps had been taken in the prosecution of the claim for more than a year. On 10 February 1989 the plaintiffs served a Summons for Directions, the deadline for which had expired on 2 February 1985.\n\nOn 27 February 1989 the plaintiffs made an application for specific discovery and the defendants made a further application for security for costs. These, together with the Summons for Directions, came before the District Registrar on 7 April 1989 but were adjourned. According to the applicant, this adjournment was due to failure by the court registry properly to notify the defendants\u2019 counsel of the hearing date. The Government state that it was due to the parties not having ensured that sufficient court time would be available. A further hearing was proposed for 1 September 1989 but was also adjourned. At a hearing on 25 October 1989 the District Registrar decided to adjourn in order to refer the matters before him to the High Court, which held hearings on 15, 17 and 24 January 1990. The application for security for costs was dismissed.\n\nOn 12 February 1990 an Order for Directions was made by consent of all the parties, who indicated that they would not be prepared for trial before 1 October 1990. The trial was listed for 4 June 1991.\n\nThe defendants made a payment into court of GBP 50,000 on 1 November 1990, and a second payment of GBP 50,000 on 10 April 1991. These payments failed to procure a settlement and the trial began on schedule, but had to be adjourned on 18 June 1991 as the applicant was ill. It was recommenced on 29 April 1992 and ran until 11 June 1992. On 2 October 1992, judgment was given in the plaintiffs\u2019 favour. However, the damages award was limited to GBP 5 to each plaintiff since they could not establish that the venture would have been a commercial success had it proceeded.\n\nThe plaintiffs appealed in December 1992. The plaintiffs were required, inter alia, to lodge a transcript of the material evidence given at trial by 1 March 1993, but failed to do so until 28 February 1994 due to delays in production of the transcripts by a company of court reporters.\n\nIn the meantime, the defendants applied for security for costs for the appeal. A hearing on the application took place on 29 March 1993. Judgment on the application was reserved, but in the event no decision was required since Ferranti plc were put into receivership in December 1993. The receivers took over conduct of Ferranti plc\u2019s role in the case thereafter. Ferranti Instrumentation Limited had stopped trading and ceased to exist altogether in November 1996\n\nOn 21 March 1994, the Court of Appeal allocated a hearing date of 5 or 6 December 1994 for the appeal. However, in light of the uncertainties associated with Ferranti\u2019s receivership, the appeal was stood out of the list by consent until 31 March 1995.\n\nAfter that date the Civil Appeals Office (\u201cCAO\u201d) made a number of attempts to confirm whether or not the plaintiffs would be pursuing the appeal. On 18 June 1996 the applicant informed the CAO that he would be proceeding in person. On 2 October 1996 the applicant telephoned the CAO to enquire about hearing dates but was told that his files could not be found at that time. His request for a hearing date was passed to the Court of Appeal\u2019s Registrar on 14 November 1996 and on 6 March 1997 the Registrar directed that the CAO should liaise with the defendants to ascertain their status, which was confirmed in a letter from the defendants\u2019 solicitors received on 25 March 1997. A letter from the CAO to the applicant of 1 May 1998 indicated that the CAO had learned of the defendants\u2019 status separately some time during 1995 or 1996.\n\nOn 8 April 1998 the CAO wrote to the applicant with details of the files which it had located. On 17 June 1998 the Registrar directed that the case be listed as soon as possible after the summer vacation. In August 1998 the CAO learnt that Ferranti Instrumentation Limited had been struck off the register of companies.\n\nOn 21 October 1998 the Customer Service Unit of the Court Service wrote to the applicant acknowledging that there had been significant delay in listing the appeal (due to matters outside the authorities\u2019 control) and that the applicant had not been properly kept informed about progress on the case and had had to chase the court unnecessarily for information. The applicant was offered an ex gratia payment to cover his wasted costs in connection with the Court Service\u2019s admitted failures.\n\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal on 13 January 1999, noting in doing so that even if the applicant had won he would not have benefited financially given the financial state of the one remaining defendant (Ferranti plc). On 19 April 1999 the Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 request for leave to appeal to the House of Lords.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) on 24 November 1998, within the three-month period laid down by former Articles 32 \u00a7 1 and 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 32819/96) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under former Article 25 by a Jamaican citizen, Mr Clive Caballero, on 28 June 1996. The applicant was represented by Mr P. Leach and, subsequently, by Ms M. Cunneen, both lawyers with Liberty, a civil liberties non-governmental organisation based in London. The Government of the United Kingdom (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr H. Llewellyn, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The Commission\u2019s request referred to former Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (former Article 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention taken both alone and in conjunction with Article 13 and under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3.\n\nHaving been designated before the Commission by the initials C.C., the applicant subsequently agreed to the disclosure of his name by the Court.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of Protocol No. 11 taken together with Rules 100 \u00a7 1 and 24 \u00a7 6 of the Rules of Court, a panel of the Grand Chamber decided on 14 January 1999 that the case would be examined by the Grand Chamber of the Court. The Grand Chamber included ex officio Sir Nicolas Bratza, the judge elected in respect of the United Kingdom (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 24 \u00a7 4), Mr L. Wildhaber, the President of the Court, Mrs E. Palm, Vice-President of the Court, and Mr J.-P. Costa and Mr M. Fischbach, Vice-Presidents of Sections (Article 27 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and Rule 24 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 (a)). The other members appointed to complete the Grand Chamber were Mr A. Pastor Ridruejo, Mr J. Makarczyk, Mr P. K\u016bris, Mr R. T\u00fcrmen, Mrs F. Tulkens, Mrs V. Str\u00e1\u017enick\u00e1, Mr V. Butkevych, Mr J. Casadevall, Mrs H.S. Greve, Mr A.B. Baka, Mr R. Maruste and Mrs S. Botoucharova (Rule 24 \u00a7 3). Subsequently Sir Nicolas Bratza, who had taken part in the Commission\u2019s examination of the case, withdrew from sitting in the Grand Chamber (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Sir Robert Carnwath to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1). Later Mr G. Bonello, substitute judge, replaced Mr T\u00fcrmen, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 24 \u00a7 5 (b)).\n\nAfter consulting the Agent of the Government and the applicant\u2019s representative, the Grand Chamber decided to dispense with a hearing in the case, being of the opinion that the discharging of its functions under Article 38 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention did not require one to be held (Rule 59 \u00a7 2).\n\nOn 17 May, 3 June, 19 August and 10 September 1999 the applicant and the Government variously produced a number of documents, either at the President\u2019s request or of their own accord.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nIn 1987 the applicant, who was born in 1926, was convicted of manslaughter by the Central Criminal Court, London. His record sheet read \u201cmanslaughter \u2013 heavy drinking session with female. In bed, during which he sexually interferes with her. Struggle ensues during which she dies\u201d. The naked body of the victim, a neighbour of the applicant, was discovered outside the door of her flat wrapped in a bedspread. The applicant was sentenced to four years\u2019 imprisonment. He was released in August 1988.\n\nOn 2 January 1996 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of attempted rape of his next-door neighbour. He maintained that he had had sexual intercourse with the woman with her consent and the woman claimed that the incident had taken place after she had blacked out from drinking. He was brought before the Magistrates\u2019 Court on 4 January 1996. While the applicant instructed his solicitor to apply for bail on his behalf, no bail application was or could have been made in view of section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. The record of the hearing of 4 January 1996 refers to section 25 of the 1994 Act as the reason for the refusal of bail. The applicant was remanded in custody by the Magistrate on 4 and 11 January 1996, the second appearance being necessary in view of the possibility (later abandoned) of the prosecution amending the charge against the applicant.\n\nThe applicant was convicted of attempted rape and of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in October 1996. On 17 January 1997 he was sentenced to four years\u2019 imprisonment for the assault conviction and to life imprisonment for the attempted rape conviction. The trial court deducted the period of his pre-trial detention from the sentence imposed pursuant to section 67 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967. On 11 July 1997 the Court of Appeal rejected his appeal against sentence.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 35615/03) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Polish nationals, Mr W\u0142adys\u0142aw Krzych and Mr Tadeusz Gurbierz (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 31 October 2003.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Agent Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 1 September 2005 the President of the Fourth Section decided to communicate the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the length of proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI.THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1942 and 1946 respectively and live in Rybnik, Poland.\n\nIn 1992 and 1993 the prosecutor conducted an investigation in connection with the applicants\u2019 allegedly illegal business activities.\n\nOn 16 December 1993 they were charged with fraud.\n\nIn July 1994 the applicants were indicted before the Katowice Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki).\n\nOn 18 October 1994 the trial court held the first hearing.\n\nIn 1995 the court held nine hearings. Some of them were adjourned or cancelled due to the absence of witnesses. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 the trial court scheduled numerous hearings. However, most of them were either adjourned due to the absence of witnesses or cancelled.\n\nOn 10 December 1998 the Katowice Regional Court gave judgment. The court convicted the applicants and sentenced them to suspended prison terms of one year and six months and two years respectively.\n\nThe applicants appealed against the judgment.\n\nThe Katowice Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) held one hearing on 27 April 2000 and on the same date gave judgment. The court quashed the impugned judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 6 September 2000 the Katowice Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy) held the first hearing.\n\nIn January 2001 the court decided that the Gliwice Regional Court was competent to examine the case.\n\nThe trial court held hearings in May, July and November 2001. Subsequently, hearings were held at year-long intervals: in October 2002 and September 2003. The hearing in September 2003 was held before the Racib\u00f3rz District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) to which, in the meantime, the case had been transferred.\n\nThe Racib\u00f3rz District Court held several hearings and on 28 September 2004 it gave judgment. The trial court convicted the applicants but reduced the suspended prison terms to which they had been sentenced.\n\nThe applicants appealed.\n\nOn 2 November 2004 the applicants lodged with the Katowice Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) a complaint about a breach of the right to have their case heard within a reasonable time. They relied on the 2004 Act on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time. On 14 December 2004 the Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed the complaints. The court examined the course of the impugned proceedings only as regards the period between 2002 and 2004 when the case had been pending before the District Court and established that the proceedings had been conducted diligently. It further held that the trial courts could not be held responsible for delays caused by the absence of witnesses or illness of the parties.\n\nOn 21 February 2005 the Gliwice Regional Court dismissed their appeal against the judgment of 28 September 2004. The judgment is final.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 40555/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Ekrem \u00dctebay (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 1 October 2004.\n\nBy a letter of 11 March 2007, the Registry was informed of the death of the applicant. His parents, Mrs Muhteber \u00dctebay and Mr \u0130yasettin \u00dctebay, and his brother, Mr Ercan \u00dctebay, declared their intention to pursue the application.\n\nFor practical reasons, Mr \u00dctebay will continue to be called \u201cthe applicant\u201d in this judgment, although his family is now to be regarded as such (see Ahmet Sad\u0131k v. Greece, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011V, p. 1641, \u00a7 3).\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr F. Babao\u011flu, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 6 November 2006 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1973 and lived in \u0130stanbul. He died on 14 June 2005.\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.\n\nOn 7 March 1994 the applicant was taken into police custody in Mu\u015f on suspicion of being a member of the illegal PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party). On 13 March 1994 he was handed over to the Istanbul Security Directorate for further investigation.\n\nOn 21 March 1994 the applicant was taken before the investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court, who ordered his detention pending trial.\n\nBy an indictment dated 23 June 1994, the public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and forty-five other defendants before the Istanbul State Security Court, accusing them, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation and of involvement in activities that undermined the constitutional order of the State. The prosecution requested that the applicant be sentenced pursuant to Article 125 of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn 5 May 1999 the Istanbul State Security Court, composed of three judges including a military judge, decided that the applicant's case should be separated from the file as his final defence submissions had not been submitted to the court.\n\nOn 18 June 1999 the Constitution was amended and the military judge sitting on the bench of the Istanbul State Security Court was replaced by a civilian judge.\n\nThe case against the applicant continued before the Istanbul State Security Court. In the course of the proceedings the State Security Court rejected the applicant's requests for release, taking into account the nature of the alleged offence and the state of the evidence.\n\nOn 5 April 2004 the applicant was released pending trial. The case was still pending before the domestic courts when the applicant died on 14 June 2005.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 62324/00) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Polish national, Mr Wojciech Depa (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 26 May 1999.\n\nThe Polish Government were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 1 December 2005 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Krak\u00f3w, Poland.\n\nOn 14 January 1998 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 16 January 1998 the Krak\u00f3w District Court (S\u0105d Rejonowy) decided to detain the applicant on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed offences of kidnapping, sequestration, attempted murder and theft. The court established that there was a risk that the applicant might tamper with evidence as he had attempted to intimidate the victim and that he might abscond since two other alleged perpetrators had gone into hiding.\n\nBetween 27 March and 11 August 1998 the applicant served a prison sentence ordered in another set of criminal proceedings.\n\nOn 6 April 1998 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki) prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question and on the need to continue the investigation, in particular so that he could undergo a psychiatric examination.\n\nOn 14 July and 27 October 1998 the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was further prolonged. The latter decision was taken at a public hearing at which the applicant and his lawyers were present. The court found that keeping the applicant in custody was justified by the strong suspicion that he had committed the offences, the probability that a severe sentence would be imposed and the fact that the third alleged perpetrator was still in hiding.\n\nThe applicant appealed against those decisions arguing that there was no evidence that once released he would obstruct the proper course of the proceedings or abscond. The applicant further asked the court to take into consideration his difficult family situation as his parents needed his support.\n\nIn the meantime, on 13 July 1998, the applicant was indicted before the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court (S\u0105d Okr\u0119gowy).\n\nAt a hearing held on 16 February 1999, at which the applicant was present, the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention. The court found: \u201cThe fact that [the applicant] has been charged with having committed attempted murder is a sufficient ground for imposing the most severe preventive measure, that is detention on remand.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, on 14 May and 16 August 1999, the applicant\u2019s detention on remand was prolonged by the trial court. The first decision was taken at a public hearing at which the applicant and his lawyers were present. The court relied on the strong probability that the applicant had committed the offences and the advanced stage of the trial.\n\nOn several occasions the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests to attend the court\u2019s session at which his appeals against the decisions to prolong his pre-trial detention were examined. The court established that the presence of the applicant was not necessary as he was represented by two lawyers of his choice who could attend the court\u2019s session.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s numerous applications for release and appeals against the decisions to prolong the detention were to no avail.\n\nIn 1999 the trial court held in total thirteen hearings.\n\nOn 10 January 2000 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court gave a judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant lodged an appeal. On 13 April 2000 the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, quashed the impugned judgment and remitted the case. The court further decided to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention on remand. His lawyers were present at the hearing.\n\nOn 27 July 2000 the trial court held the first hearing at which the applicant and his lawyers were present. The Regional Court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention justifying it with reference to the reasonable suspicion that he had committed offences in question and the severity of the anticipated penalty. The court dismissed the applicant\u2019s argument that his detention was contrary to international treaties, in particular the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nOn 24 August 2000 the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s request to attend the session at which his appeal against the decision of 27 July 2000 was to be examined, on the grounds that his presence was neither obligatory nor necessary. On the same date the court dismissed the appeal. It also dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests to release him from detention and to apply another preventive measure instead, such as bail. The Court found that his family\u2019s situation was not as difficult as the applicant had indicated. It further established that the severity of the anticipated penalty was a sufficient ground (\u201csamodzielna przes\u0142anka\u201d) for his continued detention and was consistent with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. Nevertheless, the court decided to limit the period for which the detention was to be prolonged to 31 January 2001. The applicant\u2019s lawyer was present at the session.\n\nAfterwards, the applicant\u2019s detention was further prolonged at public hearings held on 22 November 2000 and 20 April, 13 June, 27 September and 13 December 2001. The applicant and his lawyers were present at these hearings. In the meantime, the court held a session on 23 February 2001 at which it prolonged the detention. One of the applicant\u2019s lawyer was present. It appears that on each occasion the Regional Court repeated the grounds for detention given previously: the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences and the severity of the penalty that might be imposed. The court further dismissed the applicant\u2019s requests for release and found that the situation of his parents and his state of health were undoubtedly difficult but not \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. The decisions were upheld on appeal by the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s numerous requests for release were to no avail. His applications and appeals against the decisions to prolong his detention were dismissed at court sessions. The applicant\u2019s lawyers were present at most of those sessions.\n\nOn 6 February 2002 the Krak\u00f3w Regional Court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment.\n\nOn 19 September 2002 the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal partly allowed the appeal. The applicant was acquitted of the charge of attempted murder and his sentence was reduced to five years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nSubsequently, the applicant\u2019s court-appointed lawyer lodged on his behalf a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy). On 3 June 2003 the Supreme Court partly allowed the cassation appeal, quashed the appeal court\u2019s judgment and remitted the case.\n\nOn 24 June 2004 the Krakow Court of Appeal gave a judgment. The court amended its judgment of 19 September 2002 but it upheld the applicant\u2019s sentence. The judgment became final.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 57592/08) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Arthur Hutchinson (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 10 November 2008.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr J. Turner, a lawyer practising in North Shields with Kyles Legal Practice, assisted by Mr J. Bennathan QC and Ms K. Thorne, counsel. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Addis, Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his whole life sentence gave rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\n\nOn 10 July 2013 the complaint under Article 3 was communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1941 and is detained in Her Majesty\u2019s Prison Durham.\n\nIn October 1983, the applicant broke into a family home, stabbed to death a man, his wife and their adult son and repeatedly raped their 18 year\u2011old daughter, having first dragged her past her father\u2019s body. He was arrested several weeks later and charged with the offences. At trial he pleaded not guilty, denying the killings and claiming that the sex had been consensual. On 14 September 1984, at Sheffield Crown Court, he was convicted of aggravated burglary, rape and three counts of murder.\n\nThe trial judge sentenced the applicant to a term of life imprisonment and recommended a minimum tariff of 18 years to the Secretary of State for the Home Office. When asked to give his opinion again on 12 January 1988, the judge wrote that \u201cfor the requirements of retribution and general deterrence this is genuinely a life case\u201d. On 15 January 1988 the Lord Chief Justice recommended that the period should be set at a whole life term stating that \u201cI do not think that this man should ever be released, quite apart from the risk which would be involved\u201d. On 16 December 1994, the Secretary of State informed the applicant that he had decided to impose a whole life term.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the applicant applied to the High Court for a review of his minimum term of imprisonment. On 16 May 2008, Tugendhat J handed down judgment in the applicant\u2019s case ([2008] EWHC 860 (QB)), finding that there was no reason for deviating from the Secretary of State\u2019s decision. The seriousness of the offences alone was such that the starting point was a whole life order. In addition, there were a number of very serious aggravating factors. Tugendhat J made express reference to an impact statement from the surviving victim, which described \u201csadistic as well as sexual conduct\u201d. There were no mitigating factors. On 6 October 2008, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in two applications against the United Kingdom lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d). The first applicant, Mr Jonathan Moore, was born in 1973 and is resident in Scotland and the second applicant, Mr Garrick Gordon, was born in 1953 and is resident in Cornwall. Both applicants are British nationals and were represented before the Court by Mr Gilbert Blades, a solicitor practising in Lincoln. The applications were introduced on 10 June and 7 August 1997 and were registered on 16 June and 18 August 1997 under file nos. 36529/97 and 37393/97, respectively. The applicants complained, under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that they were denied a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The first applicant also submitted that he was denied a voice in the choice of venue for his court-martial.\n\nOn 20 May 1998 the Commission (First Chamber) decided to give notice of the applications to the respondent Government and invited them to submit their observations on their admissibility and merits. The Government, represented by Mr Martin Eaton, Agent, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, responded by letter dated 21 August 1998, stating that the Government did not have any observations to make on the admissibility of the applications in light of the judgment of this Court in the Findlay v. the United Kingdom case (25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, no. 30).\n\nFollowing the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 \u00a7 2 thereof, the applications fell to be examined by the Court.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the cases to the Third Section. The Chamber constituted within the Section included Sir Nicolas Bratza, the judge elected in respect of the United Kingdom (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 26 \u00a7 1(a) of the Rule of Court) and Mr J.-P. Costa, the President of the Chamber (Rules 12 and 26\u00a7 1(a)). The other members designated by the latter to complete the Chamber were Mr L. Loucaides, Mr P. K\u016bris, Mr W. Fuhrmann, Mrs H.S. Greve and Mr K. Traja (Rule 26 \u00a7 1 (b)).\n\nOn 2 March 1999 the Chamber decided to join the cases and not to hold a hearing on the merits. The Chamber also declared the applications admissible.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\n1. The circumstances of the case\n\nAt the time of the events in question, both applicants were serving in the Royal Air Force and were tried by district courts-martial convened pursuant to the Air Force Act 1955 (\u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d).\n\nMr Moore was found guilty of common assault contrary to the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and he was fined \u00a3400, although the 1988 Act provides for a maximum sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 16 below). His subsequent petitions and appeals, as far as the single judge of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, were unsuccessful.\n\nMr Gordon was found guilty of two charges of disgraceful conduct of an indecent kind (in the nature of indecent exposure, contrary to section 66 of the 1955 Act) and he was sentenced to a reduction in rank, although section 66 provides for a maximum sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 16 below). His subsequent petitions and appeals, as far as the full Courts-Martial Appeal Court, were unsuccessful.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 11375/02) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a German national, Mr Anton Kaleta (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 1 June 2001.\n\nThe Polish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wo\u0142\u0105siewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The German Government did not make use of their right to intervene (Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the Polish authorities had failed to take effective steps to enforce his right of contact with his daughter, which had violated his rights under Article 8 of the Convention\n\nOn 12 July 2006 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Taufkirchen, Germany.\n\nThe applicant and W.K. had a daughter M., born on 11 June 1989. The couple married in August 1989. The applicant and his wife separated on 1 August 1992.\n\nOn 3 September 1992 W.K lodged a divorce petition with the Katowice Regional Court (S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki). On 9 February 1993 the proceedings were discontinued as she had withdrawn her petition.\n\nIn 1993 W.K. again lodged a petition for divorce, this time with the Family Court in Munich.\n\nBetween 23 February 1994 and 3 August 1994 W.K. was detained on charges of child abduction and theft. On 3 August 1994 she was acquitted by the Munich Court.\n\nOn 27 February 1995 the Munich District Court awarded custody rights to W.K. The court considered that the mother took great care of the child and that the child had very good living conditions at her mother\u2019s place.\n\nOn 15 June 1994 the applicant lodged an application with the B\u0119dzin District Court for sole custody of his daughter.\n\nOn 22 June 1995 the District Court in B\u0119dzin, Poland, gave a decision. The court awarded parental rights to W.K and limited the applicant\u2019s rights to visiting rights. The court did not specify the access arrangements. The court also restricted W.K.\u2019s parental rights by appointing a guardian to supervise her in the exercise of her rights.\n\nMeanwhile, on 9 December 1994 the applicant asked the court to specify the access arrangements.\n\nOn 5 October 1995 the B\u0119dzin District Court gave a decision pursuant to the provisions of the Hague Convention. It allowed the applicant to visit the child on the first Friday of each month between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. The meeting was to take place on the premises of the B\u0119dzin Family Centre (O\u015brodek pomocy dziecku i rodzinie w B\u0119dzinie). In addition, W.K and a court guardian were to be present during the meeting.\n\nOn 14 November 1996 the Bedzin Family Centre confirmed that between October 1995 and 14 November 1996 the applicant failed to report for visits. On the other hand, the child and the mother were present at every meeting.\n\nOn 20 November 1996 the applicant applied to the B\u0119dzin District Court to change the access arrangements. He wished to see his daughter during ten days of the winter holidays and two weeks in summer. On 27 November 1997 the B\u0119dzin District Court dismissed his request.\n\nOn 25 November 1996 the applicant lodged an application with the Munich District Court challenging his paternity with respect to M.K. However, a DNA test confirmed his paternity.\n\nOn 15 August 1997 the Family Court in Munich dissolved the applicant\u2019s marriage and awarded parental rights to W.K.\n\nOn 5 January 1998 W.K. instituted proceedings before the B\u0119dzin District Court in which she requested that the applicant be divested of his parental rights on the ground that he had been aggressive towards her. She further requested that the court prohibit the applicant from having contact with his daughter.\n\nOn 20 October 1998 the applicant asked the court to dismiss W.K.\u2019s request. He also requested that it grant him parental authority and limit W.K.\u2019s parental authority to a right to have contact with the child. He submitted that W.K. was incapable of bringing up a child and had a history of criminal convictions for theft. In addition, criminal proceedings against her were pending (for assault on the applicant).\n\nOn 9 March 2000 the B\u0119dzin District Court gave a decision and dismissed both the applicant\u2019s and his ex-wife\u2019s requests. It also varied the contact arrangement of 1995. The court allowed the applicant to visit his daughter three times a year, on the first Friday of every fourth month between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. The court held that the meeting was to take place on the premises of the B\u0119dzin Family Centre and W.K. and a court guardian were to be present during the meetings.\n\nThe applicant appealed. On 7 June 2000 the Katowice Regional Court dismissed his appeal. The court repeated the reasons given by the District Court.\n\nOn 20 June 2000 the Katowice District Court convicted W.K. of assault on the applicant.\n\nA further cassation appeal by the applicant was dismissed by the Supreme Court (S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy) on 12 December 2000. The court referred to the child\u2019s best interest.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001 W.K. failed to report with the child to the B\u0119dzin Family Centre for visits. In particular, on 7 January, 5 May, and 1 September 2000, and 5 January and 4 May 2001 the applicant was present at the B\u0119dzin Family Centre. On all these occasions the mother did not bring the child.\n\nThe applicant met his daughter on 7 September 2001, 4 January, 4 May and 10 May 2002.\n\nOn October 2001 the applicant made a request for modification of his contact arrangements. He asked to see his daughter without the presence of the mother and the guardian. On 22 May 2002 the B\u0119dzin District Court gave a decision. On the basis of an expert\u2019s report the court considered that contact with the applicant had been very stressful for the child. For these reasons and in view of the well-being of the child the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request.\n\nOn 11 October 2001 the applicant made a request to the Family Division of the B\u0119dzin District Court under Article 1050 of the Code, asking the court to fine W.K. for failure to comply with the order of 9 March 2000. On 5 June 2002 the court dismissed his request.\n\nOn 20 October 2003 the applicant met his daughter in the B\u0119dzin Family Centre.\n\nIn August 2004 the applicant\u2019s daughter (then fifteen years old) sent a letter to her father stating that she did not wish to see him.\n\nOn 3 September 2004 the mother again failed to bring M. for a visit.\n\nOn 15 December 2004 the applicant made a request to the Family Division of the B\u0119dzin District Court under Article 1050 of the Code, asking the court to fine W.K. for failure to comply with the order of 9 March 2000. He also asked the court to vary the contact arrangements and to allow him to visit his daughter three times a year, on the first Friday of every fourth month between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.\n\nOn an unknown date the request to impose a fine on W.K. was transferred to the Civil Division of the B\u0119dzin District Court. On 20 October 2005 she was fined (1,000 Polish zlotys (PLN)) for failing to appear at meetings. Her appeal against his decision was dismissed on 15 February 2006.\n\nOn 7 January 2005 the B\u0119dzin District Court gave a decision and dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for modification of the contact arrangements. The court heard the sixteen -year-old M., who stated that she did not wish to have any contact with the applicant. The court held that it was not in the child\u2019s best interest to vary the visiting arrangements.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 11 September 1992, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 15058/89) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 2 December 1988 by a British citizen, Dr Royce Darnell. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 26 September 1992, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr Th\u00f3r Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Mr B. Walsh, Mr C. Russo, Mr S.K. Martens, Mrs E. Palm, Mr A.N. Loizou and Mr A.B. Baka (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Subsequently Mr N. Valticos, substitute judge, replaced Mr Th\u00f3r Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1).\n\nMr Ryssdal assumed the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5) and, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government of the United Kingdom (\u201cthe Government\u201c), the applicant\u2019s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). In accordance with the order made in consequence, the Registrar received on 29 January 1993 the applicant\u2019s memorial and, on 1 February, the Government\u2019s. On 15 April 1993 he was informed by the Commission\u2019s secretariat that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\n\nIn accordance with the President\u2019s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 20 April 1993. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mrs A. Glover, Legal Counsellor, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr M. Baker, Q.C., Counsel, Mr G. Berry, Department of Health, Mr M. Evans, Department of Health, Mr J. Evans, Trent Regional Health Authority, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission Mr L. Loucaides, Delegate;\n\nfor the applicant Ms F. Hampson, senior lecturer in law at the University of Essex, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr Baker for the Government, by Mr Loucaides for the Commission and by Ms Hampson for the applicant, as well as replies to its questions.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nThe applicant, Dr Royce Darnell, who was born in 1929, has been unemployed since the Trent Regional Health Authority (\u201cthe RHA\u201c) terminated his employment as a consultant microbiologist and Director of the Public Health Laboratory in Derby. This case concerns the length of time that proceedings relating to this dismissal have taken.\n\nFollowing administrative changes in the National Health Service in 1977, management problems arose in many regions including the Trent RHA. As a result of differences over staff appointment procedures, in October 1979 a local grievance procedure was initiated against Dr Darnell before the Area Health Authority (\u201cthe AHA\u201c) by the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs. Although Dr Darnell was considered by the British Medical Association\u2019s legal department to have been acting within the terms of the Government\u2019s guidelines in Health Service Circular (IS) 16, the AHA endorsed the new appointments procedure.\n\nFollowing further disagreement, a formal complaint was made in December 1980 by the AHA to the Trent RHA alleging non-compliance with laboratory staff appointment procedures. Dr Darnell was informed by letter of 19 March 1981 that a sub-committee had been set up to deal with the AHA\u2019s formal complaint. After various investigations had been carried out, a disciplinary procedure under circular HM (61) 112 was instituted against Dr Darnell by the Trent RHA. By letter of 25 June 1982 he was suspended from duty pending the outcome.\n\nAfter attempts to settle the case had failed, a panel of inquiry sat for thirty-two days between June and August 1983. It reported in December that the applicant was at fault in certain respects. A sub-committee subsequently appointed by the Trent RHA recommended that Dr Darnell\u2019s employment as a consultant microbiologist be terminated. Accordingly, by letter of 16 May 1984 from the Trent RHA, the applicant was dismissed on three months\u2019 notice with effect from 19 August 1984.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Secretary of State against his dismissal on 23 May 1984. A professional committee was appointed in accordance with paragraph 190 of the Terms and Conditions of Service of Hospital Medical and Dental Staff. The paragraph 190 procedure has since been replaced by a new procedure which incorporates time-limits into the various stages of an appeal to the Secretary of State against dismissal. After holding a hearing on 14 May 1985, the professional committee reported to the Secretary of State who, in September 1985, sought further information.\n\nThe Secretary of State directed the RHA to offer Dr Darnell a new post in the region without managerial responsibility. In reaching this decision the Secretary of State had noted that the professional committee had been very critical of the handling of the case. The RHA challenged this direction. The applicant was informed by the Department of Health and Social Security (\u201cthe DHSS\u201c) that in view of the unavailability of alternative employment, the case had been remitted to the Secretary of State who, not being bound by the professional committee\u2019s recommendation to allow the appeal, had decided that the termination of Dr Darnell\u2019s services in accordance with the paragraph 190 procedure should be confirmed.\n\nBy judicial review proceedings commenced in the High Court on 24 April 1986, the applicant challenged the fairness of the procedure leading to the Secretary of State\u2019s decision. The High Court granted a declaration that this decision was invalid and indicated that the Secretary of State should reconsider the matter. The Secretary of State did not appeal.\n\nOn 25 October 1986 the applicant informed the DHSS that he now sought a further paragraph 190 hearing. An exchange of correspondence took place. The DHSS attempted to convoke an ad hoc committee meeting, but this was cancelled as the applicant refused to accept such a compromise. On 29 February 1988, having proceeded on the basis of the written material which included further written submissions, the Secretary of State decided to confirm the applicant\u2019s dismissal. Accordingly, by letter of 18 March 1988, the DHSS informed the applicant that, on the basis of the professional committee\u2019s report of 25 July 1985 and the written submissions made by Dr Darnell and the Trent RHA, re-employment was not a possibility and termination of his services was effective from the date of that letter.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s application for judicial review of the validity of the Secretary of State\u2019s direction was dismissed on 3 November 1988.\n\nIn the meantime, the applicant had also sought reinstatement, re-engagement and damages for dismissal by proceedings in the Industrial Tribunal. Two applications had been made to the Tribunal, the first on 10 August 1984 following his dismissal in May of that year and the second in May 1986 following the Secretary of State\u2019s initial rejection of his appeal against dismissal. These proceedings had been stayed from time to time at the applicant\u2019s request, pending the results of the appeal to the Secretary of State and the judicial review proceedings. In November 1988, the second Industrial Tribunal application was revived and the first was subsequently withdrawn. A pre-hearing assessment took place on 6 February 1989 in which the Tribunal determined that a hearing could take place with no cost consequences to the applicant. In its reserved decision of 23 February 1990, the Tribunal held that the dismissal of the applicant was not unfair. It had not been persuaded that the applicant had in any way been prejudiced by the time which had elapsed until a decision was finally reached. He had been paid his salary in full until March 1988.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal was dismissed on 8 April 1993.\n\nIn June 1988 a separate action in the High Court claiming damages for the applicant\u2019s suspension from work in June 1982 pending the outcome of the disciplinary procedure was struck out as it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. An appeal against the striking out was dismissed in 1990. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n\nDr Darnell lodged his application (no. 15058/89) with the Commission on 2 December 1988. He complained under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention that the \u201ccivil rights\u201c proceedings taken against him which led to the final termination of his employment took an unreasonable length of time; he also alleged that the Secretary of State and the RHA had followed a procedure which was neither fair nor public and that the former was not independent or impartial. In addition, he claimed that, contrary to Article 13 (art. 13), he had no effective domestic remedy for those Convention complaints.\n\nOn 10 April 1991 the Commission declared the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the length of the proceedings admissible and dismissed the remainder of his application. In its report of 13 May 1992 drawn up under Article 31 (art. 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (unanimously). The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the concurring opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 42735/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mrs Joyce Barrow (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 22 November 2002.\n\nThe United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant alleged that as a woman she was unable to receive invalidity benefit after the age of 60, whereas a man could receive such benefit until the age of 65. The case raised issues under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 27 April 2004, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nFollowing the judgment of the Grand Chamber in Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, 12 April 2006), the Government, but not the applicant, submitted further observations.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Wrexham.\n\nIn August 2003 the applicant turned 60 years of age. Prior to that date she was in receipt of long-term incapacity benefit (IB), a benefit payable to people incapable of work who satisfy the eligibility criteria. She had qualified for the rate of 81.85 pounds sterling (GBP) per week. She was also paid GBP 39.95 per week in disability living allowance (DLA) and GBP 15.15 in DLA care. At age 60, which is the date of entitlement to the State pension for women, she ceased to be eligible for IB. In its place she became entitled to draw her state retirement pension which, based upon her contribution record, entitled her to GBP 57.81 per week (about 62% of the maximum rate as she had only contributed for 24 years out of 39). She continued to draw DLA. As a result, the applicant claimed that she was some GBP 24.04 per week worse off as a result of her transition from IB to the State pension.\n\nThe applicant complained to the Department of Work and Pensions concerning the differential treatment but was informed that nothing could be done.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 68693/01) against the Kingdom of Denmark lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Danish nationals, Mr Karl Gustav Pedersen (the first applicant) and Jens Otto Pedersen (the second applicant), respectively born in 1958 and 1938, and living in L\u00f8gst\u00f8r and Hobro.\n\nThe first applicant was represented by Mr Uffe Baller, a lawyer practising in \u00c5rhus. The second applicant was represented by Mr Tyge Trier a lawyer practising in Copenhagen. The Government are represented by their Agent, Ms Nina Holst\u2011Christensen of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe applicants alleged, in particular, that the criminal charges against them had not been determined within a reasonable time within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 12 June 2003 the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI 7. On 20 October 1992 the first applicant, as the owner of 3 freshwater fish farms, was charged with offences against the Act on freshwater fish farms of 5 April 1989 (bekendtg\u00f8relse nr. 224), henceforth also called the 1989 Act, as allegedly he had intentionally exceeded the fixed feed quotas with danger or risk thereof to the environment, and with enrichment for himself. 8. On 13 September 1993 an indictment was submitted to the City Court in Fjerritslev (retten i Fjerritslev) before which the trial was scheduled for 9 December 1993. However, the trial was adjourned awaiting the outcome of a corresponding pending criminal case, considered to be a \u201ctest-case\u201d, in which the defendant had alleged inter alia that the 1989 Act had no legal authority as it contravened articles of the Penal Code and provisions of the Environmental Protection Act (Milj\u00f8beskyttelsesloven). The Government claimed that the adjournment was initiated by the first applicant\u2019s counsel. The applicant contested this. It is undisputed, however, that the parties agreed to the adjournment and that no objections were raised against it. The proceedings in the test-case were finally determined on appeal by a High Court judgment of 21 September 1995. 9. Subsequent to a preliminary hearing held in the applicant\u2019s case on 18 December 1995 it was decided to adjourn his case anew awaiting another corresponding pending criminal case, considered to be a test-case, in which the defendant had alleged that the 1989 Act had no legal authority as the European Commission had not been notified of it as allegedly prescribed by the 83/189/EEC Council Directive of 28 March 1983 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations, amended by the 88/182/EEC Council Directive of 22 March 1988. The proceedings in the corresponding case were finally determined on appeal in the autumn of 1996 when a High Court delivered its judgment. 10. The applicant\u2019s trial commenced on 8 April 1997. Since a witness on the applicant\u2019s behalf was prevented from appearing on that day, the trial continued and ended on 14 May 1997. By judgment of 28 May 1997 the City Court in Fjerritslev convicted the applicant and sentenced him to pay a fine of 68,000 Danish kroner (DKK). In addition a profit estimated to DKK 275,000 was confiscated. 11. On 9 June 1997 the applicant appealed against the judgment to the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret) before which he was granted permission to procure an expert witness, who during the preparation of the case was requested to reply in writing to specific questions formulated by counsel, and approved by the prosecutor. 12. By judgment of 29 June 1998 the High Court of Western Denmark upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction, but increased the fine to DKK 95,000 and the amount to be confiscated to DKK 384,000. 13. The applicant\u2019s request of 7 July 1998 for leave to appeal against the High Court\u2019s judgment to the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) was granted by the Leave to Appeal Board (Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet) on 23 November 1998. 14. The case was brought before the Supreme Court on 15 January 1999, where it was joined with the second applicant\u2019s appeal (see below). II 15. On 26 October 1993, the second applicant, as manager of two limited companies which each owned a freshwater fish farm, was charged with offences against the amended Act of 31 September 1994 on freshwater fish farms partly in conjunction with the former Act of 5 April 1989 (bekendtg\u00f8relse nr. 900 jfr. tildels bekendtg\u00f8relse nr. 224), as allegedly he had intentionally exceeded the fixed feed quotas with danger or risk thereof to the environment, and with enrichment for the companies. 16. The case was brought before the City Court in Mariager (retten i Mariager) by the prosecution\u2019s submission of an indictment of 8 March 1994, which was later extended by supplementary indictments. 17. In the period between September 1994 and October 1995 the case was adjourned awaiting the outcome of a corresponding pending criminal case, which was considered to be a test-case. 18. On 3 November 1995 the proceedings were adjourned at the request of the applicant\u2019s counsel, who wished to submit a written pleading. On 21 November 1995 counsel requested an extension of the time-limit for submitting his pleading. On 12 February 1996 he stated that his pleading was approaching. On 21 March 1996 he was granted yet another extension of the time\u2011limit, and on 17 April 1996 the pleading was submitted. 19. Further pleadings were submitted and additional preliminary issues were dealt with, inter alia with regard to counsel\u2019s request that the applicant\u2019s case be joined with another corresponding pending case. 20. On 4 October 1996 counsel was granted an extension of the time\u2011limit to submit his rejoinder within eight weeks. 21. A hearing was held on 24 February 1997 and the case was scheduled to commence on 8 September 1997 as counsel had stated that he was unable to appear before that date. 22. On 16 September 1997 the City Court in Mariager convicted the applicant and sentenced him to pay a fine of DKK 275,000. In addition profits estimated to DKK 900,000 and DKK 200,000, respectively, were confiscated in the companies. 23. On 23 September 1997 the applicant appealed against the judgment to the High Court of Western Denmark, before which the case was ready to be listed for trial on 27 November 1997. As counsel was unable to appear on the proposed dates in January, February and May 1998, the case was scheduled for trial on 27 August 1998. 24. By judgment of 3 September 1998 the High Court of Western Denmark upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction, but increased the fine to DKK 345,000 and the amounts to be confiscated to DKK 1,158,000 and DKK 240,000 respectively. 25. The applicant\u2019s request of 11 September 1998 for leave to appeal against the High Court\u2019s judgment to the Supreme Court was granted by the Leave to Appeal Board on 23 November 1998. 26. The case was brought before the Supreme Court on 15 January 1999, where it was joined with the first applicant\u2019s appeal. The applicants jointly argued that the Act of 1989 had no legal authority as the European Commission had not been notified of it as allegedly prescribed by the 83/189/EEC Council Directive of 28 March 1983 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations, amended by the 88/182/EEC Council Directive of 22 March 1988, and that accordingly they should be acquitted. Moreover, they requested that the Supreme Court referred the question of the legal consequences of the non-notification to the European Court of Justice pursuant to the former Article 177 of the EC Treaty. 27. As to the latter the Prosecutor General procured an opinion from the Ministry of Justice of 29 January 1999, finding no basis for a preliminary reference, an opinion he endorsed. On 4 February 1999 the Supreme Court requested counsel\u2019s comment on this issue. 28. On 17 February 1999 the applicants requested that an additional counsel be assigned to plead on the EU-law issues of the case. This was refused by the Supreme Court on 24 February 1999. The following day, the applicants requested that a named attorney substitute their counsel as to the EU\u2011law issues. This request was granted on 18 April 1999 and the proceedings were adjourned for eight weeks pending comments from the substituting counsel. 29. It appears that the substituting counsel three times was granted an extension of the time-limit to submit his comments, thus his first written pleading was submitted on 5 October 1999. 30. The Prosecutor General stated definitively on 3 November 1999 that he found no basis for referring the case to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. 31. The exchange of pleadings on this question continued until 7 April 2000, as the substitute counsel three times requested that the Prosecutor General submit written replies to various questions put by counsel on the issue. Each time the replies were followed by a comprehensive pleading by the substitute counsel. 32. On 22 August 2000 the Supreme Court decided not to refer the case to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling, as it found that there was no obligation to notify the European Commission of the specific section of the Act on freshwater fish farms of 5 April 1989, with which the applicants were charged, and that there was no reasonable doubt that the section in question was in accordance with European Community legislation. 33. By judgment of 16 February 2001 the Supreme Court upheld the High Court\u2019s judgment in respect of the first applicant, but reduced the amount to be confiscated to DKK 240,000, and by judgment of the same date the Supreme Court upheld the High Court\u2019s judgment in its entirety in respect of the second applicant.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 13378/05) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two British nationals, Ms J.M. and Ms S.D. Burden (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 29 March 2005.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Ms E. Gedye of Wood, Awdry and Ford, solicitors practising in Chippenham. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Grainger, Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicants complained under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, when the first of them died, the survivor would be required to pay inheritance tax on the dead sister's share of the family home, whereas the survivor of a married couple or a homosexual relationship registered under the Civil Partnership Act 2004, would be exempt from paying inheritance tax in these circumstances.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nOn 30 June 2005 the President decided to give the case priority treatment under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court and that the admissibility and merits should be examined jointly, in accordance with Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and Rule 54A.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed written observations (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). On 11 April 2006 the Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, to hold a hearing on the admissibility and merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 3 in fine).\n\nThe hearing on admissibility and merits took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 12 September 2006. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Ms K. McCLEERY, Agent, Mr J. CROW Counsel, Mr J. COUCHMAN, Adviser, Ms S. TARIQUE, Adviser, Mr R. LINHAM, Adviser, (b) for the applicant Mr S. GRODZINSKI, Counsel, Ms E. STRADLING Solicitor, The Court heard addresses by Mr Crow and Mr Grodzinski, as well as their answers to questions put by Judge Bratza.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nThe applicants are unmarried sisters, born on 26 May 1918 and 2 December 1925 respectively. They have lived together all their lives; for the last 30 years in a house built on land inherited from their parents in Wiltshire.\n\nThe house is owned by the applicants in their joint names. According to an expert valuation dated 12 January 2006, the property was worth GBP 425,000, or GBP 550,000 if sold together with the adjoining land. The sisters also jointly own two other properties, worth GBP 325,000 in total. In addition, each sister owns in her sole name shares and other investments worth approximately GBP 150,000. Each has made a will leaving all her property to the other.\n\nThe applicants submitted that the value of their jointly-owned property had increased to the point that each sister's one-half share was worth more than the current exemption threshold for inheritance tax (see paragraph 13 below), and that the survivor might have to sell the house in order to pay the tax.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 63679/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by Mr Waldemar Szulc (\u201cthe applicant\u201d) on 22 October 2000.\n\nThe applicant was unrepresented before the Court. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nBy a decision of 12 November 2002 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance and Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance and declared inadmissible the remainder of the application. Subsequently, under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, the President of the Chamber, to which the case had been allocated, decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Leicester.\n\nHis wife died on 16 February 1996, leaving two children of ten and twelve years of age respectively. His claim for widows\u2019 benefits was made on 9 February 1997 and was rejected on 18 February 1997 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows\u2019 benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant appealed and his claims were consistently rejected up to the most recent decision dated 23 October 2000.\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant made a claim to the Inland Revenue, requesting an allowance equivalent to that received by a widow, namely Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance (\u201cWBA\u201d). After various rejections, on 20 September 2000 the Inland Revenue confirmed that he was ineligible for WBA as he was not a woman.\n\nThe applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security or tax benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 28226/04) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Adnan Levent \u00c7amlar (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 4 August 2004.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr A. Cang\u0131, a lawyer practising in \u0130zmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 24 June 2013 the complaints under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(d) of the Convention concerning the independence and impartiality of the \u0130zmir State Security Court and the applicant\u2019s inability to examine or have examined witnesses were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1965 and lives in London.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings against the applicant in the United Kingdom\n\nOn 29 April 1997 the applicant was arrested in London on suspicion of trafficking of illegal drugs.\n\nOn the same day he was placed in police custody, where he was informed that he would be charged with importation of a controlled drug, namely diamorphine.\n\nIn his statements before the British police, the applicant maintained that he had been importing clothing goods from Turkey and had not been aware of the trafficking of drugs by his partners.\n\nOn 15 September 1998, after having heard witness statements and evaluated all relevant evidence, the Crown Court acquitted the applicant of all charges and ordered his release.\n\nB. Criminal proceedings against the applicant in Turkey\n\nOn 16 June 1997 the public prosecutor at the \u0130zmir State Security Court filed an indictment with that court, accusing certain persons of trafficking of illegal drugs by establishing a criminal organisation pursuant to Article 403 of the former Criminal Code (Law no. 765). In that indictment, the public prosecutor indicated the involvement of the applicant in the alleged acts, without bringing any charges against him.\n\nOn 19 August 1997 the public prosecutor issued an indictment, accusing the applicant of the same offence as the others. The public prosecutor stated that the applicant had actively participated in the transfer of the illegal drugs from Turkey to the United Kingdom and noted that he was in detention on remand in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn a report dated 13 June 1997, the public prosecutor stated that the British authorities had provided him with the tapes of the applicant\u2019s police statements as well as other evidence on the alleged offence.\n\nOn an unspecified date in 1997, the Magistrates\u2019 Court ordered the applicant\u2019s detention on remand in absentia.\n\nAt a hearing on 24 February 1998 the \u0130zmir State Security Court joined the proceedings against the applicant with the proceedings against the other persons involved in the same offence. At this hearing the domestic court also requested the case file of another set of related proceedings, which contained the statements of a certain F.A.\n\nOn 5 November 1998 one of the co-accused, B.\u04e6., gave his statements before the court, maintaining that he had been hired by the applicant for the receipt and storage of certain goods which he had not known to be drugs.\n\nOn 3 December 1998 the lawyer of one of the co-accused submitted to the national court the applicant\u2019s certificate of acquittal issued by the Crown Court.\n\nOn 15 July 1999 the military judge sitting on the \u0130zmir State Security Court hearing the applicant\u2019s case was replaced by a civilian judge.\n\nOn 20 September 1999 the applicant went back to Turkey; he was placed in detention on remand the following day.\n\nAt the subsequent hearing on 30 September 1999, the applicant submitted his statements before the court and denied his involvement in the trafficking of illegal drugs. In particular, he contested the incriminating statements of B.\u04e6. and F.A. The applicant further requested to have certain witnesses, including his counsel in the United Kingdom, heard. The \u0130zmir State Security Court rejected that request, finding that the statements of the witnesses called by the applicant would not contribute to the case in view of the information already available concerning the proceedings in the United Kingdom. The court went on to decide that the applicant should be released pending trial.\n\nDuring the numerous hearings which followed, the court deferred the examination of the case to the subsequent hearings, awaiting information as regards certain accused in the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the hearing on 18 February 2003, the public prosecutor submitted his written opinion, requesting that the accused be found guilty as charged, mainly on the basis of the investigation conducted in the United Kingdom and the evidence obtained during another set of proceedings concerning the same offence.\n\nOn 21 March 2003 the applicant submitted his written defence to the court and requested his acquittal. He argued that he could not be found guilty on the basis of evidence which according to the British court was insufficient to prove his involvement in the alleged acts.\n\nOn 27 March 2003, on the basis of the investigation conducted by the British authorities, the statements of B.\u04e6. and those made by F.A., which had been taken in another set of proceedings, the \u0130zmir State Security Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to twenty four years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine.\n\nOn 31 March 2003 the applicant appealed against that judgment. During the appeal proceedings before the Court of Cassation the applicant submitted that the first instance court had based his conviction on evidence which he could not challenge, in particular the statements made in his absence by B.\u04e6. and F.A.\n\nOn 4 March 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the \u0130zmir State Security Court. The higher court indicated that the offence at issue concerned the exportation of illegal drugs and accordingly the case differed from that concluded in the United Kingdom. The high court dismissed the applicant\u2019s remaining grounds for appeal without further elaboration.\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant went to the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the new Criminal Code (Law no. 5237), in June 2005, the applicant requested the reassessment of his case and the application of the more favourable clauses in the new Code.\n\nOn 16 December 2005, after having examined the case file, the \u0130zmir Assize Court reduced the applicant\u2019s sentence to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment and decreased the amount of the fine.\n\nOn 28 June 2006 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment, stating that the first-instance court was to hold a hearing.\n\nFollowing several hearings, which the applicant had not attended as he had not returned to Turkey, on 3 July 2008 the \u0130zmir Assize Court sentenced the applicant to twenty years and ten months of imprisonment and a fine pursuant to Article 188 of the Criminal Code (Law no. 5237).\n\nFollowing the applicant\u2019s appeal, on 9 April 2009 the Court of Cassation held a hearing and heard the submissions of the applicant\u2019s lawyer. Finally, the higher court upheld the judgment of the \u0130zmir Assize Court with a minor procedural correction.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 28867/03) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by Gerard Keegan and Moira Keegan, husband and wife, and their children, Carl, Michael, Katie and Sophie, on 4 September 2003.\n\nThe applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr Topping, a lawyer practising in Liverpool. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Grainger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicants alleged that their home had been unjustifiably broken into and searched by police officers, relying on Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 11 October 2005, the Chamber declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicants, but not the Government, filed further observations (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 3 in fine).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants are Gerard Keegan, an Irish citizen born in 1955, and Moira Keegan, a United Kingdom national born in 1963, husband and wife, and their children, Carl, Michael, Katie and Sophie, United Kingdom citizens born in 1985, 1996, 1997 and 1997 respectively. They were all resident in Liverpool.\n\nIn April 1999 the applicants became tenants of a house owned by Liverpool City Council at 19 New Henderson Street. The property had been vacant for six months and the previous tenant had been Anita or Joseph De La Cruz.\n\nMeanwhile a series of armed robberies was carried out by a number of armed males: on 29 January 1997, 30 April, and 13 August 1999. On 14 August 1999, the police arrested a certain Heffy, later convicted for the robbery. They also arrested a man who arrived during the arrest. He gave his name as Dean Metcalfe but subsequent investigation revealed that he was Dean De La Cruz, son of Anita De La Cruz. He was not charged and was released. The police were tasked with investigating, and arresting, any further members of the gang and recovering the money from the robberies. The information which came into their possession indicated that Dean De La Cruz had often given 19 New Henderson Street as his address, that saliva taken from a scarf in a car abandoned after a robbery matched that of Dean De La Cruz and that Anita De La Cruz was still on the voters\u2019 register as residing at that address.\n\nOn 18 October 1999 Detective Constable Wilson went before a Justice of the Peace and applied on oath for a warrant to search 19 New Henderson Street for cash stolen during the robberies. He swore on oath that he had reasonable cause to believe that such stolen cash was in the possession of the occupier of the property. A search warrant was issued permitting a search of the premises for the cash.\n\nOn 21 October 1999, at 6 a.m., the police officers gathered at police headquarters. It was intended to search eight properties. Sergeant Gamble and four other officers were detailed to go to 19 New Henderson Street. They were briefed that Dean De La Cruz was linked to the robberies and given a photograph of him. They knew that the robberies had involved the use of firearms. They were instructed to obtain forcible entry at 7 a.m. to coincide with the other searches.\n\nThe police team used a metal ram to make a hole in the door. They experienced some difficulty as a previous tenant had reinforced the door.\n\nThe noise of the battering ram awoke and frightened the applicants. The first applicant came down the stairs and was told by the police who they were and to open the door. The first applicant complied and the sergeant entered and showed his warrant card and explained that he was looking for Dean Metcalfe. A cursory examination of the house took place to verify that no one save the applicants was present. The sergeant apologised to the first and second applicants and arranged for repairs to be made to the front door. The police left at about 7.15 a.m.\n\nThe applicants brought proceedings against the Chief Constable of Merseyside Police for the tort of maliciously procuring a search warrant, unlawful entry and false imprisonment. They alleged that they had been caused terror, distress and psychiatric harm. Medical reports indicated that the applicants were suffering from varying degrees of post traumatic stress disorder.\n\nOn 31 October 2002 the County Court Judge rejected the applicants\u2019 claims. He made a number of findings of fact or inferences: \u2013 that the police made enquiries prior to the search with utility companies and Liverpool County Council Housing Department about 19 New Henderson Street and that the rough police notes of these enquiries had been destroyed or mislaid from which he drew the adverse inference that such checks revealed that Anita De La Cruz was no longer living there but that the applicants were; \u2013 that the police considered covert surveillance of the property but decided that this was not advisable as there were sophisticated criminals living in the area who were skilled at spotting covert police operations; \u2013 that Sergeant Gamble had reasonable grounds, following his briefing, for believing that a person wanted for robbery was to be found on the premises and that he had not been informed that the applicants were now living there.\n\nThe judge found on the facts that the police, who were investigating serious and violent offences, had not acted with reckless indifference to the lawfulness of their acts, which element was necessary for the tort of maliciously procuring a search warrant. He held that the entry was made subject to a lawful search warrant and also under the powers of section 17 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allowed entry without warrant where intending to arrest a person for an arrestable offence. He found that the method of forcible entry was justified as the police had foremost in their minds the potential danger from the use of firearms by the suspect robber and in particular that the sergeant had no cause to suspect that innocent people were the only ones on the premises. He found that once on the premises there was no indication that the police had physically detained the applicants or ordered them to remain in one place. He noted that the sergeant had speedily realised the mistake, apologised and shown compassion for the applicants\u2019 plight, in particular by not lengthening the ordeal.\n\nHe concluded: \u201c... It will be difficult for the claimants to accept that their innocent occupation of their property was devastated by the events, albeit of only fifteen minutes, which occurred on 21 October 1999. Any system of justice must balance competing interests and this is a classic case of competing interests being balanced. On the one hand, the need to bring to justice violent criminals, on the other the need to try and preserve the sanctity and integrity of a law-abiding family\u2019s home... but in every case of competing interests, the scales will have to come down on one side or the other. In my judgment the scales come down in favour of the defendants and all claims are dismissed.\u201d\n\nThe applicants appealed, alleging, inter alia, that the judge had failed to consider properly whether the police had reasonable and probable cause to apply for a warrant to search for stolen cash at 19 New Henderson Street.\n\nOn 3 July 2003 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal. While Lord Justice Kennedy found that if proper enquiries had been made and the results properly reported there would have been no reasonable or probable cause to apply for a search warrant, he held that the requirement of malice was not made out as there was no evidence of any improper motive (incompetence or negligence did not suffice). He further held that the entry, being made under a warrant which was on the face of it lawful, was itself lawful and that while those responsible for sending Sergeant Gamble and his team to the address had been mistaken that did not deprive them of legal protection. Lord Justice Ward commented that the shoddy detective work did not justify a finding in the police\u2019s favour and that the case caused him concern. However, notwithstanding his anxious consideration and sympathy for the family, he stated: \u201cThat an Englishman\u2019s home is said to be his castle reveals an important public interest, but there is another public interest in the detection of crime and the bringing to justice of those who commit it. These interests are in conflict in a case like this and on the law as it stood when these events occurred, which is before the coming into force of the Human Rights Act 1998, which may be said to have elevated the right to respect for one\u2019s home, a finding of malice on the part of the police is the proper balancing safeguard. Upon careful reflection, I agree with my Lords that it is inevitable that malice will not be proved in this case.\u201d\n\nCounsel advised as follows on the prospects of obtaining leave to appeal to the House of Lords: \u201c4. Essentially, on the issue of malicious procurement of a search warrant and in trespass, the court has thought that prior to the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998, proof of malice is a necessary component of such a challenge and that the evidence was not there to prove it. It seems to me that this conclusion will not be displaced by the House of Lords. I also think, on the authorities relating to the Human Rights Act 1998, that there is no question of the House of Lords suggesting that the courts below should have done anything differently in their approach to the case.\n\nIn my view, therefore, the prospects of seeking leave to appeal from the House of Lords are poor and I do not advise that such leave be sought.\u201d",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36936/05) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Edward Szuluk (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 14 October 2005.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr J. Scott, a lawyer practising at Langleys Solicitors in York. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms H. Moynihan of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the monitoring of his medical correspondence while he was in prison breached his right to respect for his correspondence and private life under Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn 7 February 2008 the President of the Chamber decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and is currently in prison in Staffordshire.\n\nA. The applicant\u2019s brain haemorrhage and initial confidentiality of his medical correspondence\n\nOn 30 November 2001 the applicant was sentenced by a Crown Court to a total of fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment for conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and two offences of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply.\n\nOn 6 April 2001, while on bail pending trial, the applicant suffered a brain haemorrhage for which he underwent surgery. On 5 July 2002 he underwent further surgery. Following his discharge to prison, he required monitoring and was required to go to hospital every six months for a specialist check-up by a neuro-radiologist.\n\nIn 2002 the applicant was held in a high-security prison which held Category A (high-risk) prisoners as well as Category B prisoners such as himself. As a result, he fell within the provisions of a general order, Prison Service Order (PSO) 1000, which applied to all prisoners of whatever security category who were being held in a unit which held Category A prisoners (see paragraph 28 below).\n\nThe applicant wished to correspond confidentially with his external medical specialist to ensure that he would receive the necessary medical treatment and supervision in prison. He expressed his concerns about his medical correspondence with his external medical specialist being read and applied to the prison governor for a direction that such correspondence should be accorded confidentiality.\n\nOn 18 September 2002 the governor of the prison in which the applicant was being detained agreed to the applicant\u2019s request. It was decided that the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence would not be read provided that certain conditions were met. All outgoing and incoming mail was to be marked \u201cmedical in confidence\u201d. Outgoing correspondence would be checked to ensure that it was being sent to a nominated address and incoming mail was to be marked with a distinctive stamp of the relevant health authority.\n\nB. Subsequent monitoring of the applicant\u2019s correspondence\n\nThe prison governor subsequently reconsidered his decision after seeking advice from HM Prison Service Headquarters. On 28 November 2002 the prison governor informed the applicant that he had been advised that it was necessary to examine his medical correspondence for illicit enclosures. All correspondence between the applicant and his external medical specialist would be directed, unopened, to the prison medical officer. The latter would examine the content of the envelope in order to ascertain its medical status and then reseal it. Incoming and outgoing correspondence would then be sent to the applicant and his external medical specialist respectively.\n\nThe applicant contested the decision to monitor his medical correspondence. He was concerned that his attempts to confirm that he was receiving adequate treatment in hospital might be regarded by the prison medical officer as criticism and that this might inhibit his relationship with his external medical specialist.\n\nC. Judicial review proceedings\n\nOn 4 August 2003 the applicant applied for leave to apply for judicial review of the prison governor\u2019s decision of 28 November 2002. On 20 February 2004 the presiding High Court judge, Mr Justice Collins, allowed the applicant\u2019s claim for judicial review.\n\nThe Prison Service had submitted, inter alia, that it would be difficult to make the necessary arrangements to permit medical correspondence to remain confidential. They argued that there were a large number of health bodies with which a prisoner might wish to correspond and that some health bodies might lack franking machines that would enable prisons to identify the authenticity of the sender.\n\nMr Justice Collins concluded that there were exceptional circumstances in the applicant\u2019s case. The exceptional circumstances were said to be the life-threatening nature of the applicant\u2019s condition and his desire to ensure that his treatment in prison did not affect him adversely. The applicant, understandably, wanted to obtain reassurance from the medical specialist who was involved in treating him and from whom he required continual medical care, in the form of biannual specialist observations. Mr Justice Collins also found that the initial decision of the prison governor to enable the applicant to correspond on a confidential basis with his external medical specialist indicated that it was reasonable to permit such confidential correspondence. The evidence of the Prison Service as to the practical problems involved in making arrangements to enable confidential medical correspondence were not directly material in an exceptional case such as the present one.\n\nIn the circumstances, and emphasising that this was a case which turned on its own exceptional facts, Mr Justice Collins considered it appropriate to quash the prison governor\u2019s decision of 28 November 2002. He granted the applicant a declaration that \u201cthe governor of whatever prison the [applicant] resides [in] should make a decision in accordance with the principles made in light of this judgment\u201d.\n\nD. The proceedings before the Court of Appeal\n\nOn 29 October 2004 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal by the Secretary of State and the prison governor. Lord Justice Sedley gave the judgment of the court. It was noted that there was no dispute that the reading of prisoners\u2019 correspondence was governed by law, and that it was directed to the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The issue to be decided was whether, in the language of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the reading of the applicant\u2019s correspondence was proportionate. While the prison governor\u2019s initial decision to allow confidentiality to the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence with his external medical specialist strongly suggested that its exemption from Chapter 36.21 of PSO 1000 would be a perfectly reasonable course, the onus still remained on the applicant to establish that anything more invasive would constitute a disproportionate interference with his Article 8 rights.\n\nThe Court of Appeal concluded that although the procedure set out in the prison governor\u2019s letter of 28 November 2002 amounted to an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence, the interference was justified and proportionate under Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. It considered that although it was of course possible to verify the existence, address and qualifications of the applicant\u2019s external medical specialist (whose bona fides was not in question), there was no way of ensuring that the latter would not be intimidated or tricked into transmitting illicit messages. While the same was true of, for example, the secretarial staff of members of parliament (MPs), the importance of unimpeded correspondence with MPs outweighed the risk. By contrast, as regards correspondence with doctors, the prisoner\u2019s health was the concern and the immediate responsibility of the Prison Medical Service. Though it may well be the case that allowing the prison medical officer to read the prisoner\u2019s correspondence with an outside medical practitioner might lead the former to \u201cencounter criticism of his own performance\u201d, it was inherently unlikely that this would carry the same degree of risk that might attend the reading by a discipline officer of a letter of complaint to the Prisons Ombudsman. Moreover, if it related to the prisoner\u2019s well-being it was probable that the prison medical officer ought in any event to know about it.\n\nThe Court of Appeal concluded that the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence was a proportionate interference with his Article 8 rights, although it did not exclude the possibility that in another case it might be disproportionate to refuse confidentiality to medical correspondence in the prison context. The Court of Appeal based its conclusion on the following factors. Firstly, the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence answered legitimate and pressing policy objectives which were clearly stated in Chapter 36.1 of PSO 1000 (see paragraph 28 below). Secondly, short of withdrawing all scrutiny, it considered that there was no less invasive measure available to the prison service. Thirdly, the reading of the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence which was limited to the prison medical officer was not in its view excessive. Fourthly, the process by which the measure had been decided upon was not found to be arbitrary. In particular, it had not been the result of the rigid application of a policy. The withdrawal of monitoring had not only been considered but had been implemented until, upon reconsideration, monitoring had been resumed. The interference in question had not denied the essence of the applicant\u2019s Article 8 rights as it related to one correspondent only (the external medical specialist) and it confined the interference to a medically qualified reader (the prison medical officer). It was recognised that there was an inescapable risk of abuse, for example, if the applicant\u2019s prison life or treatment was made more difficult because of what he was observed to be writing. However, the risk, having been minimised by virtue of confining surveillance to the prison medical officer, was outweighed by the above-mentioned factors.\n\nE. Petition to the House of Lords\n\nOn 18 April 2005 the applicant\u2019s petition for leave to appeal was refused by the House of Lords on the ground that the petition did not raise an arguable point of law of general public importance.\n\nF. The applicant\u2019s current conditions of imprisonment\n\nSince 22 May 2007 the applicant has been located in a Category B prison in Staffordshire.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in two applications against the United Kingdom lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d). The first applicant, Mr David Smith, was born in 1946 and is resident in Doncaster and the second applicant, Mr Darren Ford, was born in 1974 and is resident in Gloucestershire. Both applicants are British nationals and were represented before the Court by Mr Gilbert Blades, a solicitor practising in Lincoln. The applications were introduced on 18 August and 10 December 1997 and were registered on 25 August and 19 December 1997 under file nos. 37475/97 and 39036/97, respectively. The applicants complained, under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that they were denied a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\n\nOn 10 September 1998 the Commission (First Chamber) decided to give notice of the applications to the respondent Government and invited them to submit their observations on their admissibility and merits. The Government, represented by Mr Martin Eaton, Agent, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, responded by letter dated 20 November 1998, stating that the Government did not have any observations to make on the admissibility of the applications in light of the judgment of this Court in the Findlay v. the United Kingdom case (25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, no. 30).\n\nFollowing the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 \u00a7 2 thereof, the applications fell to be examined by the Court.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the cases to the Third Section. The Chamber constituted within the Section included Sir Nicolas Bratza, the judge elected in respect of the United Kingdom (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 26 \u00a7 1(a) of the Rule of Court) and Mr J.-P. Costa, the President of the Chamber (Rules 12 and 26\u00a7 1(a)). The other members designated by the latter to complete the Chamber were Mr L. Loucaides, Mr P. K\u016bris, Mr W. Fuhrmann, Mrs H.S. Greve and Mr K. Traja (Rule 26 \u00a7 1 (b)).\n\nOn 30 March 1999 the Chamber decided to join the cases and not to hold a hearing on the merits. The Chamber also declared the applications admissible.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\n1. The circumstances of the case\n\nAt the time of the events in question, both applicants were serving in the British Army. Mr Smith was tried by a general court-martial and Mr Ford was tried by a district court-martial, both courts-martial having been convened pursuant to the Army Act 1955 (\u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d).\n\nMr Smith was found guilty of, inter alia, four disciplinary offences of conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline contrary to section 69 of the 1955 Act. He was sentenced to be dismissed from the army, although section 69 provides for a maximum sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment (see paragraph 17 below).\n\nMr Ford was found guilty of, inter alia, three counts of common assault contrary to Criminal Justice Act 1988 and he was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe applicants\u2019 subsequent petitions and appeals, as far as the full Courts-Martial Appeal Court, were unsuccessful.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 28091/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Graham Thorne (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 25 October 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Royds Rdw, solicitors in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London\n\nThe applicant complained under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, because he was a man, he was denied social security benefits equivalent to those received by widows.\n\nBy a partial decision of 12 November 2002 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning widows\u2019 benefits which had been made within the applicable time-limits. Subsequently, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Kent.\n\nHis wife died on 25 January 2001. He made an oral claim for benefits on 16 February 2001. His formal claim for widows\u2019 benefits, namely Widow\u2019s Payment (\u201cWpt\u201d) and Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance (\u201cWMA\u201d) was made subsequently, allegedly on 2 March 2001, and was rejected on 28 June 2001 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows\u2019 benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.\n\nThe applicant was in receipt of child benefit at the time of his claim.\n\nUpon the introduction of the new benefit scheme, as of 8 April 2001 the applicant started receiving Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance instead of WMA.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe cases originated in two applications (nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two British nationals, Mr George Runkee and Mr Brian White (\u201cthe first and second applicants\u201d), on 20 July 1998 and 4 October 1999 respectively.\n\nThe United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London. The applicants were represented by Mr S. Right, Legal Officer of the Child Poverty Action Group.\n\nThe applicants complained that, as men, they were not entitled to receive widows' benefits, including Widow's Pension, equivalent to those available to comparable bereaved women.\n\nBy decisions dated 7 June 2001 and 4 April 2002, respectively, the Court declared the applications admissible. On 9 September 2003 the applications were adjourned pending the conclusion of related domestic proceedings (see paragraphs 22-24 below). On 18 May 2005 the Court invited the parties to submit observations on the merits.\n\nThe Government and the applicants requested a hearing on the merits, but the Court decided that it would not be necessary.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES\n\nThe facts of each case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nA. Mr Runkee\n\nMr Runkee was born in 1938 and lives in Hull.\n\nHe married in 1964. He and his wife had three children, born in 1965, 1966 and 1974. On 15 March 1998 his wife died. She had worked full time for eight years until becoming pregnant and had made full social security contributions.\n\nThe applicant notified the Benefits Agency of his wife's death and of his intention to claim \u201cwidowers' benefits\u201d on 31 March 1998. By a letter dated 16 April 1998, the Benefits Agency informed the applicant that because he was not a woman he was not entitled to widow's benefits. The applicant lodged a statutory appeal against this decision on 1 May 1998, but abandoned it when advised that the appeal was bound to fail.\n\nAt the time of his application to the Court, Mr Runkee was in receipt of means-tested statutory benefits, including Income Support and Housing and Council Tax Benefits. Were he a woman, his entitlement to Widow's Pension would have been offset against these benefits, to the extent that, in his present circumstances, he would have received no additional money in respect of Widow's Pension.\n\nB. Mr White\n\nMr White is a United Kingdom national, born in 1942 and living in Warrington.\n\nHe married in 1960. He and his wife had two children, one of whom was adopted and born in 1955, the other of whom was born in 1968.\n\nOn 8 March 1999 his wife died. She had worked until the birth of her son in 1968 and had made reduced social security contributions.\n\nThe applicant notified the Benefits Agency of his wife's death and of his intention to claim \u201cwidowers' benefits\u201d on 10 March 1999. On 21 June and 8 September 1999, Angela Eagle, a Minister from the Department of Social Security, wrote to the applicant's Member of Parliament confirming that as a man he was not entitled to claim widows' benefits.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 63476/00) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by Mr Neil Steff (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 26 September 2000.\n\nThe applicant was represented before the Court by Ms P. Glynn, a solicitor practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant complained under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, because he was a man, he was denied social security and tax benefits equivalent to those received by widows.\n\nBy a partial decision of 15 January 2002 the Court decided to communicate this application. On 6 May 2003, after obtaining the parties\u2019 observations, the Court declared the application admissible in so far as the complaint concerned Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance and Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Hertfordshire.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s wife died on 9 February 1999, leaving two children, born in 1987 and 1992. On 11 May 2000 the applicant applied for widow\u2019s benefits. By a letter dated 15 May 2000, the Benefits Agency informed him that it was unable to pay him any of the benefits claimed because he was not a woman.\n\nOn 6 June 2000 the applicant applied for an allowance under the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 on the same basis as he would receive it if he were a widow whose husband died in similar circumstances. He only received a letter of reply on 25 July 2000.\n\nThe applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no social security or tax benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 14549/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by Mr Rodney Cummins (\u201cthe applicant\u201d) on 6 March 2002.\n\nThe applicant was unrepresented before the Court. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant complained under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, because he was a man, he was denied social security benefits equivalent to those received by widows.\n\nBy a partial decision of 12 November 2002 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning widows\u2019 benefits and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. Subsequently, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Gosport.\n\nHis wife died on 29 March 2001. His claim for widows\u2019 benefits was made on 29 June 2001 and was rejected on 31 December 2001 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows\u2019 benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant appealed. On 7 May 2002 his appeal was heard and dismissed. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 64735/01) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by Mr John Higham (\u201cthe applicant\u201d) on 24 October 2000. Having originally been designated by the initials J.H., the applicant subsequently agreed to the disclosure of his name.\n\nThe applicant was unrepresented. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to grant him Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance or equivalent constituted discrimination on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nBy a partial decision of 4 December 2001 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. It also decided to join this application to other applications (nos. 60525/00, 60933/00, 60937/00, 60944/00, 61038/00, 61388/00, 61949/00, 62776/00, 63388/00, 63464/00, 63469/00, 63470/00, 63473/00, 63474/00, 63584/00, 63645/00, 63701/00, 63702/00, and 65723/01). By a decision of 26 August 2003 the Court declared the remainder of the application admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Blackpool.\n\nHis wife died on 7 September 1997. On 19 July 2000 the applicant made a claim to the Inland Revenue requesting an allowance equivalent to that received by a widow, namely Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance (\u201cWBA\u201d). On 16 August 2000 the Inland Revenue informed him that he was ineligible for WBA as he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such allowance was granted to widowers under United Kingdom law.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 19840/09) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Harry Shindler (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 26 March 2009.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms C. Oliver, a lawyer practising in Rome. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant alleged that his disenfranchisement as a result of his residence outside the United Kingdom constituted a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, taken alone and taken together with Article 14, and Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention.\n\nOn 14 December 2010 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1921 and lives in Ascoli Piceno, Italy. He left the United Kingdom in 1982 following his retirement and moved to Italy with his wife, an Italian national.\n\nPursuant to primary legislation, British citizens residing overseas for less than fifteen years are permitted to vote in parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom (see paragraphs 10-11 below). The applicant does not meet the fifteen-year criterion and is therefore not entitled to vote. In particular, he was unable to vote in the general election of 5 May 2010.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 65507/01) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Paul Howard Ginnifer (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 29 September 2000.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms P. Glynn, a lawyer practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nBy a partial decision of 10 September 2002 the Court decided to adjourn the applicant\u2019s complaint in connection with his claims for widows\u2019 benefits, relating to discrimination suffered by him during the period after the date on which he lodged his claim for widows\u2019 benefits, to adjourn the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning Widows\u2019 Bereavement Allowance and to declare the remainder of the application inadmissible. It also decided to join the application to other applications (nos. 58372/00, 61878/00, 634477/00, 63480/00, 63647/00, 63961/00, 64986/01, 64996/01, 65202/01, 65478/01, 65741/01, 65906/01, 66181/01, 67100/01, 67913/01, 68173/01, 68175/01, 68264/01, 68298/01, 68449/01, 69076/01, 69323/01, 69327/01, 69491/01, 70521/01, 70741/01, 71176/01, 71428/01, 71429/01, 71570/01, 71758/01, 72656/01, 73646/01, 73653/01, 73978/01, 74961/01, 75092/01, 75126/01, 75993/01, 75995/01, 77129/01, 77424/01, 682/02, 2573/02, 4810/02, 10747/02, 13944/02, 14404/02 and 14537/02).\n\nSubsequently, under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, the Chamber to which the case had been allocated, decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Yeovil.\n\nHis wife died on 17 December 1996, leaving one child born in 1991.\n\nOn 20 June 2000 the applicant applied for benefits equivalent to those to which a widow, whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of his wife, would have been entitled, namely a Widow\u2019s Payment (\u201cWpt\u201d) a Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance (\u201cWMA\u201d) and thereafter a Widow\u2019s Pension (\u201cWP\u201d), payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cthe 1992 Act\u201d). On 3 July 2000 the Benefits Agency refused his claim for WMA from 17 December 1996 to March 2000 because the claim dated 20 June was not made within the three-month time limit and the rest of his claim because he was not a woman.\n\nOn 28 July 2000 the applicant appealed. On 31 August 2000 the Benefits Agency wrote to the applicant explaining the reasons for its decision. On 4 September 2000 the appeal was turned down. The decision was then sent to the Social Security Appeals Service. However, such appeal was bound to fail given that no social security benefits were payable to widowers under the domestic law.\n\nOn 17 October 2000 the applicant made an oral claim for Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance (\u201cWBA\u201d) to the Inland Revenue. These proceedings were still pending on the date of introduction of the claim before the Court and the applicant failed to inform the Court about their outcome. However, it is assumed that such claim was bound to fail. The claim for WBA in the present case would have been treated as a claim in respect of the tax years covering 1996/97 and 1997/98.\n\nThe applicant receives child benefit in the sum of GBP 70.20 per week.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 23883/06) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Swedish nationals, Mr Adnan Khurshid Mustafa and Mrs Weldan Tarzibachi (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 12 June 2006.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr U. Isaksson, a lawyer practising in Stockholm, and by Mr P.-G. Nystr\u00f6m and Ms S. Wikstr\u00f6m, lawyers of the Stockholm Tenants' Association. The Swedish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C.-H. Ehrenkrona, Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicants alleged that their eviction from their flat following their refusal to remove a satellite dish resulted in violations of Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention.\n\nOn 22 June 2007 the President of the Third Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants, a married couple of Iraqi origin, were born in 1957 and 1963 respectively and live in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s. They have three children, who are now eighteen, sixteen and eight years of age.\n\nFrom 1 November 1999 they rented a flat in Rinkeby, a suburb of Stockholm. Rule 13 of the special provisions of the tenancy agreement stipulated the following: \u201cThe tenant undertakes not to erect, without specific permission, placards, signs, sunblinds, outdoor aerials and such like on the house.\u201d The agreement further stipulated, as a general condition, that the tenants were obliged to take proper care of the flat and to maintain good sanitary conditions, order and good practice in the house.\n\nIt appears that when the applicants moved in, there was a satellite dish mounted on the fa\u00e7ade, next to one of the windows of the flat. The applicants made use of this in order to receive television programmes in Arabic and Farsi.\n\nIn October 2003 the applicants' landlord changed. The new landlord, a real-estate company, demanded that the satellite dish be dismantled. The applicants did not comply and, by letter of 2 April 2004, the company gave the applicants notice of termination of the tenancy agreement with effect from 31 July 2004.\n\nFurther, in April 2004, the landlord initiated proceedings before the Rent Review Board (hyresn\u00e4mnden) in Stockholm against the applicants and some other tenants who had installed satellite dishes in the same house. The landlord sought execution of the notice of termination, claiming that the applicants' satellite installation violated the express ban in Rule 13 of the tenancy agreement and that, by not complying with the instruction to dismantle the dish, they had failed to maintain good sanitary conditions, order and good practice. Stating that it objected only to satellite dishes mounted on or outside the fa\u00e7ade of the house, while allowing, for instance, dishes placed on a balcony, the landlord claimed that the ban on such installations was of considerable importance as the installations a) risked causing injuries to persons and property for which the landlord would be held responsible, b) damaged the house physically and aesthetically and c) obstructed rescue workers' and the landlord's access to the flat.\n\nShortly after having received the notice of termination, the applicants dismantled the satellite dish. However, in its place they installed a new device by placing on the kitchen floor an iron stand from which an arm, on which the satellite dish was mounted, extended through a small open window. The installation could be pulled back into the kitchen when not being used. At the request of the Tenants' Association, an engineer, Mr S. Tornefelt, examined the installation on 26 August 2004. He found that it was very stable but recommended that, for safety reasons, a steel wire be fixed between the dish and the stand. The applicants made the recommended addition.\n\nThe applicants, as well as the other tenants summoned, contested the landlord's claims before the Rent Review Board. They stated that, by mounting satellite dishes for the reception of television programmes, some of which were broadcast in their mother tongues, they were exercising their freedom to receive information, as protected by the Swedish Constitution, Article 10 of the Convention and EC law. The landlord's interests, as provided for in Chapter 12, section 25 of the Land Code (Jordabalken), had to be balanced against this freedom. The applicants further claimed that they had now complied with the landlord's demand that the earlier satellite installation be dismantled. The new installation was, they claimed, in conformity with the rules of the tenancy agreement. Referring to Mr Tornefelt's opinion, they further maintained that it was safe and did not damage the house. The landlord submitted, in addition to what it had previously stated, that it was working on the possibility of installing broadband and internet access in the house, which would allegedly give access to the desired television channels.\n\nFollowing an inspection of the applicants' satellite installation, the Rent Review Board gave a decision on 21 October 2004 finding in their favour. The Board noted in general that the assessment of whether tenants had failed to comply with their obligations by mounting satellite dishes had to involve the balancing of the interests of the landlord \u2013 which could be more or less strong depending on how the actual installations had been made \u2013 and the interests of the tenants in using a satellite dish \u2013 which could also vary depending on whether there were alternative means of receiving the television channels in question. In the applicants' case, the Board found that the fact that the new satellite installation extended through a window did not involve a breach of Rule 13 of the tenancy agreement. With regard to the general obligation to maintain good sanitary conditions, order and good practice in the house, the Board considered that the actual installation did not and could not damage the house. Moreover, the landlord's liability for damage to persons and property could not reasonably be incurred unless it were able to prevent the mounting and use of the satellite dish, which was not the case if the Board found that the landlord had no right to such prevention. Moreover, having regard to Mr Tornefelt's opinion and its own inspection, the Board considered that the risk of damage caused by the installation was negligible. Nor could it not find any evidence that the installation would obstruct rescue workers' access to the flat. The only inconvenience for the landlord was the aesthetic aspect. However, the applicants' interest in being able to watch television programmes that were not accessible by other available means weighed more heavily, and the satellite installation could not therefore be considered as contrary to good sanitary conditions, order and good practice.\n\nThe landlord appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal (Svea hovr\u00e4tt). The court held an oral hearing at which, inter alia, Mr Tornefelt gave evidence. It also made an inspection of the applicants' satellite installation. By a final decision of 20 December 2005, the court found that the applicants had disregarded their obligations as tenants, under the tenancy agreement and Chapter 12, section 25 of the Land Code, to such a degree that the agreement should not be extended, pursuant to Chapter 12, section 46, subsection 1(2) of the Code. They were given a respite until 31 March 2006 to move from the flat. The court found that the landlord had made a reasonable distinction between acceptable and unacceptable satellite installations and had submitted weighty reasons for prohibiting dishes mounted on the fa\u00e7ade or otherwise extending outside of it. It noted that the evidence showed that the applicants' dish was virtually always positioned outside the kitchen window and thus constituted a permanent installation, and concluded, contrary to the findings of the Rent Review Board, that its placement breached Rule 13 of the tenancy agreement. In assessing the seriousness of this breach of contract, the court first concluded, with reference to Mr Tornefelt's testimony, that the satellite installation met the reasonable requirements of stability and safety. However, noting that the landlord's main reason for not allowing the installation was the safety aspect, the court considered that the landlord was entitled to make general risk assessments and should not have to determine whether an individual installation was unsafe or inconvenient. It went on to state that, while the applicants' interest in receiving the broadcasts of the television channels in question had to be taken into consideration and that it was desirable that technical solutions for such reception be found, the right to freedom of information relied on did not have such a bearing on the case that it could be considered to have any real importance. It noted, finally, that the applicants had been fully aware of the importance that the landlord attached to the issue of the placement of satellite dishes and of the consequences that could follow from a refusal to comply with the landlord's instructions in this respect. Although their satellite installation did not pose any real safety threat, their interests could not be allowed to override the weighty and reasonable interest of the landlord that order and good custom be upheld.\n\nThe landlord offered the applicants the option of staying in their flat if they agreed to remove the satellite dish. They did not agree to do this, however, and instead moved on 1 June 2006. They have stated that, largely because of the scarcity of flats for rent in the Stockholm area but also due to there being a court eviction order against them, they were forced to move to V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, approximately 110 km west of Stockholm. As a consequence, the first applicant now had much longer and costlier trips to and from work and the applicants' three children had had to change nursery and school and leave friends.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 32848/06) against the Kingdom of Denmark lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Danish national, Mr Torben Moesgaard Petersen (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 1 August 2006.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms Sysette Vinding Kruse, a lawyer practising in Copenhagen. The Danish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms Nina Holst-Christensen of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nBy a decision of 9 October 2007 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nThe applicant submitted his claims for just satisfaction and the Government made their comments on that matter.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Charlottenlund.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s a new concept called \u201ctax asset stripping cases\u201d (selskabst\u00f8mmersager) came into existence in Denmark. It covered a criminal activity by which the persons involved committed aggravated debtor fraud by buying up and selling numerous inactive solvent private limited companies within a short period and, for the sake of their own profit, \u201cstripping\u201d the companies of assets, including deposits earmarked for payment of corporation tax. The persons involved were usually intricately interconnected and collaborated in their economic criminal activities, which concerned very large amounts of money. According to surveys made by the customs and tax authorities, approximately one thousand six hundred companies with a total tax debt exceeding two billion Danish kroner (DKK) were stripped in the period from the late 1980s until 1994. Following a number of legislative amendments, the trade in inactive, solvent companies largely ceased in the summer of 1993.\n\nAt the relevant time the applicant was part owner of a private limited stockbrokers company ([B] and [the applicant] A/S] - hereafter \u201cthe company\u201d).\n\nOn 18 January 1994 he learnt that the tax authorities were about to check the company\u2019s accounts for the years 1989 to 1992. On 6 May 1994 the tax authorities informed the applicant that the question of whether any criminal liability had occurred would be decided on later. The tax authorities also reported various potential co-offenders to the police.\n\nDuring 1994, 1995 and at the beginning of 1996 the police carried out an investigation comprising, among other things, discovery orders against banks, international letters of request, search warrants and numerous interviews of witnesses.\n\nOn 17 June 1996, the Copenhagen City Court (K\u00f8benhavns Byret \u2013 hereafter \u201cthe City Court\u201d), sitting in camera, granted the police a warrant to search the premises of the applicant\u2019s business and those of the company.\n\nOn 2 July 1996 the search was carried out by the police.\n\nFrom July 1996 to February 1998 various investigative steps were taken, also relating to five co-accused in the case, for example searches in Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden, numerous interviews in Denmark and abroad, international letters of request, a request to Interpol, fifteen discovery orders and an order prohibiting the disclosure of the applicant\u2019s name. Moreover, on 19 March 1997 a request for an accountant\u2019s report was made and material for that purpose was obtained, including statements of account, cheque vouchers and so on.\n\nOn 12 February 1998 the applicant was officially charged and interrogated by the police.\n\nOn 25 June 1998 an indictment was submitted to the City Court, according to which the applicant (and five co-accused, A, B, H, N and R) were charged with \u201ctax asset stripping\u201d committed jointly. The applicant was charged on forty-four counts out of a total of fifty-nine, committed between 26 June and 3 November 1992. His responsibility related to an amount of DKK 87,000,000, equal to approximately 11,600,000 euros (EUR) out of the total tax amount evaded in the case which came to approximately EUR 19,000,000. The indictment related to eighty different companies and six banks in Denmark and abroad.\n\nBetween July 1998 and 10 March 1999, fifteen pre-trial hearings were held and the draft of the accountant\u2019s reports was submitted. On the former date, the case was set down for trial on 15 March 1999.\n\nBetween 15 March 1999 and 31 January 2001, a total of 119 hearings were held. The applicant, the five co-accused and more than seventy witnesses were heard, including state-registered public accountants. Statements of accounts and a considerable amount of other documentary evidence were also produced. The court records comprised 1,330 pages. The closing speeches were held over ten days in November 2000 and January 2001.\n\nBy a judgment of 6 April 2001, which ran to 220 pages, the City Court convicted the applicant in accordance with the indictment. The co-accused were also convicted. The applicant was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment. In addition, the sum of DKK 3,600,000 was seized, and he was deprived for an indefinite period of the right to establish a private limited company or a company or an association requiring public approval, or to become a manager and/or member of a director\u2019s board of such companies.\n\nThe City Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim that the length of the proceedings had been at variance with Article 6 of the Convention stating the following: \u201cThe City Court finds no reason to criticise the prosecution\u2019s decision to join the criminal proceedings against the [applicant and the five co\u2011accused]. Accordingly, and having regard to the mutual connection between the cases and their character, the City Court finds no violation of Article 6 of the Convention, although there were longer periods of inactivity during one part of the case, while investigation was going on in another part of the case. In this connection [the City Court] notes that the complexity of the acts carried out by [the applicant and the five co-accused] partly when buying and \u201cstripping\u201d the companies for assets, partly when writing off projects abroad, necessitated an investigation of an extraordinary scope. In the City Court\u2019s opinion there were no longer periods, whether before the police, the prosecution or the City Court, during which no part of the case proceeded. It must be emphasised that due to the nature and scope of the charges, the cases against [the applicant] and [the co-accused B and R] could not proceed before the cases against [H, N and A] [had been heard]. [Finally], in view of the character and complexity of the case, [the City Court] considers that the total length of the proceedings did not in itself constitute a breach of the said provision of the Convention.\u201d\n\nOn 15 May 2001 the applicant and the five co-accused appealed against the judgment to the High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret - \u201cthe High Court\u201d).\n\nAfter that date, twelve preparatory hearings were held, including one on 13 September 2001 during which the trial was scheduled with numerous fixed dates to commence on 24 September 2002. Counsel for the applicant and the co-defendants jointly replied that they only had very limited possibilities to appear during the autumn of 2002.\n\nThus, although the trial commenced on 24 September 2002, most of the hearings took place in 2003 and 2004. A total of about 90 hearings were held in the case. In February and March 2004 the appeal hearings had to be postponed because a co-defendant fell ill. For the same reason the High Court changed the order of some of the hearings. The Court records comprised 861 pages. The closing speeches were held over ten days in April, May, and June 2004.\n\nOn 28 September 2004 the High Court upheld the City Court\u2019s judgment. As regards the length of the proceedings, it stated: \u201cIn the assessment of whether the proceedings have been concluded within a reasonable time, the starting point ... concerning the [applicant] was on 12 February 1998, when he was charged ... [The High Court] upholds the City Court\u2019s judgment and its reasoning with regard to the question of whether Article 6 of the Convention has been violated ... The appeal proceedings were scheduled and carried out without any unreasonable delay. On 13 September 2001 the trial was scheduled to take place on fixed dates as from 12 August 2002. A number of hearing dates in the autumn 2002 and the beginning of 2003 had to be cancelled because some counsel were occupied [with other cases], for which reason the [present] case was delayed. To avoid any further delay caused by impossibilities to appear, the trial, which commenced on 24 September 2002, proceeded in a proper, but not completely suitable order.\u201d\n\nIn the period from 7 to 12 October 2004, the applicant and the co\u2011defendants requested that the Leave to Appeal Board (Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet) grant them leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret). Three of the defendants stated in their petitions that they would submit supplementary comments, which were received on 17 December 2004. In January 2005 the cases were sent to the prosecution, which gave its opinion on 29 March 2005. The applicant and the co\u2011defendants gave their comments in reply and at a meeting on 5 August 2005 the Leave to Appeal Board decided to refuse the requests. Letters of refusal were not sent out, however, as on 9 August 2005 counsel for one of the co-defendants stated that he wanted to submit supplementary comments in the light of a recent judgment in a similar case.\n\nThereafter, due to an error, nothing happened in the case until 2 May 2006, when the police telephoned the Leave to Appeal Board and drew attention to the case. Subsequently, on his request, counsel for the relevant co-defendant who had wanted to submit supplementary comments did so on 2 and 13 June 2006. The applicant and the co-defendant were informed on 21 June 2006 that their requests for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court had been refused. At the same time the Leave to Appeal Board apologised for the length of the proceedings before it.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 11 December 1992, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 16757/90) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 8 January 1990 by a British citizen, Mr Bryan Stanford. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 29 January 1993, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr Th\u00f3r Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Mr F. Matscher, Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr J. De Meyer, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr J. Makarczyk and Mr D. Gotchev (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government of the United Kingdom (\u201cthe Government\u201c), the applicant\u2019s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). In accordance with the order made in consequence, the Registrar received on 29 June 1993 the Government\u2019s memorial and, on 22 July, the applicant\u2019s. On 21 October 1993 the applicant\u2019s submissions on Article 50 (art. 50) were received.\n\nIn accordance with the President\u2019s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 October 1993. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr I. Christie, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr P. Havers, Barrister-at-law, Counsel, Mr J. Watherston, Lord Chancellor\u2019s Department, Ms A. Jenkins, Lord Chancellor\u2019s Department, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission Mr F. Martinez, Delegate;\n\nfor the applicant Mr M. Clare, Counsel, Mr G. Platt, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Martinez, Mr Clare and Mr Havers as well as replies to its questions.\n\nOn 3 November 1993 the Government submitted their reply to the applicant\u2019s Article 50 (art. 50) submissions.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nOn 30 March 1988 the applicant, Mr Bryan Stanford, was committed for trial by jury at the Crown Court in Norwich on seven counts arising out of his relationship with a young girl: indecent assault, two counts of rape, unlawful sexual intercourse, kidnapping and two counts of making a threat to kill. The trial, before a High Court judge and a jury, lasted six working days between 8 June and 15 June 1988. Throughout the trial the applicant, who sat in a glass- fronted dock, was represented by solicitor and counsel. His counsel had been in practice for thirteen years and specialised in criminal work.\n\nOn 15 June 1988, having been found guilty of indecent assault, one count of rape, kidnapping and one count of making a threat to kill, the applicant was sentenced to a total of ten years imprisonment. He is currently serving this sentence in Her Majesty\u2019s Prison Long Lartin, in Worcestershire.\n\nDuring the trial evidence was given by, among others, Miss M., the alleged victim of the offences who was then fifteen years of age, as well as her mother and sister. When M. gave evidence the judge directed that she be moved nearer to himself and the jury since it was difficult to hear what she was saying.\n\nOn 27 July 1988 the applicant sought leave to appeal against his conviction to a single judge of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) (\u201cthe Court of Appeal\u201c) on the ground, inter alia, that at his trial he could not hear the proceedings. This was refused on 13 September 1988 as there was found to be no merit in any of his proposed grounds.\n\nOn 6 October 1988 the applicant renewed his application for leave to appeal to a full court of the Court of Appeal. He claimed, inter alia, that he had been unable to hear the original proceedings as the acoustics in the court had been inadequate. He also submitted a letter in which the prison officer who had guarded him in the dock during the trial confirmed that the applicant had on a number of occasions complained to him of his inability to hear the witnesses. The letter stated inter alia: \u201cOn at least three occasions I called his solicitor and he was told the problem. On one of these occasions he told the [applicant] not to worry as his barrister was doing a good job. I have to say that I could not hear what the witnesses were saying.\u201c\n\nIt is not disputed that the applicant was unable to hear some of the evidence nor that this was communicated to his solicitor, counsel and the prison officer guarding him. The trial transcript reveals that the applicant was, however, able to hear the indictment read out at the beginning of the trial and pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201c to each of the seven counts put to him. At no time during the trial was any complaint or representation made to the court or to any of its officials by the applicant or his lawyers concerning the claim that he could not hear the proceedings.\n\nThe applicant complained to the Solicitors\u2019 Complaints Bureau about, inter alia, the solicitor\u2019s failure to take action in respect of his difficulties in hearing the evidence. In a letter dated 19 December 1988 to the Bureau, the applicant\u2019s solicitor commented as follows on the applicant\u2019s claims: \u201cMr Stanford\u2019s trial was apparently the first case to be heard at the new Norwich Crown Court building. Throughout the trial Mr Stanford sat silently in the dock. He told me that he is someone who has a hearing problem. I assume that his failure to hear what was said relates mainly to the evidence given against him by the complainant (M.). The prosecution allegation was that Mr Stanford had abused, raped, kidnapped and threatened to kill [the complainant] and that this conduct had been going on for about two years. She claimed to have told no one because of her fear of violence from Mr Stanford and because of threats he allegedly made to harm her and her family. She spoke in a soft voice and the judge directed that she should give her evidence sitting at a table positioned between counsel and the judge. This meant that she was closer to the jury and her upper body was therefore visible to the jury rather than obscured by the witness box. Notwithstanding this she gave her evidence with her head bowed answering questions often with one word answers in a soft voice. I was nearer to her than the defendant. I could hear what she was saying. It is clear that the jury, the judge and counsel could also hear. Because of the court layout it would have been difficult for the defendant to have heard but not impossible if his hearing had been unimpaired. I had taken full instructions from Mr Stanford upon the committal papers in the form of a 22 page statement. Counsel was in my view very well acquainted with the detail of that statement and put to the complainant all matters which should have been put. I agree that Mr Stanford told me and counsel that he could not hear everything that was being said. Counsel took the view (which I shared) that as she and the jury could hear and as she would no doubt have had the opportunity of taking instructions upon any matters arising which were not contained in her brief, then there was nothing which needed to be done. It is my view that if Mr Stanford had been placed close to the complainant and facing her at the time that she was giving her evidence, then this would have been viewed by the jury as an indication of the intimidating behaviour of Mr Stanford about which [M.] was complaining.\u201c\n\nOn 6 October 1989 the full Court of Appeal refused the applicant\u2019s renewed application for leave to appeal against conviction. It held, inter alia, as follows: \u201cWe have read the grounds of appeal against conviction upon which he would seek to rely. There is no substance in any one of them. We make reference specifically to one, however, because his complaint is that he did not receive a fair trial on account, so he puts it, of \u2018poor acoustics\u2019 which prevented him from hearing the proceedings and the failure of his representative, that is to say his solicitor, to remedy that. We have seen a letter from a prison officer relating to this matter. There would appear to be something in the complaint of the applicant, namely that he could not hear properly at all times what was going on. There is no doubt in our minds, however, that his solicitor and his counsel had not the slightest difficulty in following the proceedings and in representing him in a way which could not possibly be complained about.\u201c\n\nOn 10 November 1989, the applicant was informed by the Registrar of Criminal Appeals that he could not appeal to the House of Lords, since he had not had a substantive appeal dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\n\nA similar complaint concerning acoustics in the courtroom in which the applicant had been tried, and which was in constant use from the time of its opening in 1988, was made in one other case over a year after the applicant\u2019s conviction. As a result, the landlords of the court building commissioned a report from a company specialising in acoustics. This report, dated 8 February 1990, noted that in 1988, before the building came into use as a court, tests showed that acoustic design targets had been met. It concluded that a person speaking from the Bench was intelligible in the front seat of the dock with the glass screen in position. The report also stated that the effect of the glass screens upon audibility was not considered to involve a significant drop in sound level. Notwithstanding these findings, it was subsequently decided to instal a reflector panel above the dock to overcome the very small sound loss which was due to the glass screen.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 25379/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Geoffrey Twizell (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 7 June 2002.\n\nThe United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nBy a decision of 12 November 2002 the Court decided to communicate the application. Subsequently, under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, the President of the Chamber to which the case had been allocated, decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1941 and lives in France.\n\nHis wife died on 26 March 2001. They had no children from the marriage. His claim for widows\u2019 benefits under the new system in place as from 9 April 2001 was made on 4 May 2001 and was rejected on 4 June 2001 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows\u2019 benefits. On 10 July 2001 the applicant appealed. Reconsideration took place on 23 July 2001 and the decision remained unchanged. On 15 November 2001 his appeal was heard and dismissed by an Appeal Tribunal. On 23 November 2001 the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the Social Security Commissioner. On 20 February 2002 the applicant was informed that his request had been disallowed.\n\nThe applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security or tax benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in two applications (nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Somali nationals, Mr Abdisamad Adow Sufi and Mr Abdiaziz Ibrahim Elmi (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 21 February 2007 and 14 March 2007 respectively.\n\nThe applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Ms N. Mole of the Aire Centre, a lawyer practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicants alleged that if returned to Somalia they would be at real risk of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 and/or a violation of Article 2 of the Convention. They also complained that their removal would disproportionately interfere with their rights under Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn 23 February 2007 and 14 March 2007 the Acting President of the Chamber to which the cases were allocated decided to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, indicating to the Government that it was desirable in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicants should not be expelled to Somalia pending the Court\u2019s decision. The Court also decided to grant priority to the applications under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.\n\nOn 23 February 2007 and 26 March 2007 the Acting President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the admissibility and merits of the case (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nAt the Government\u2019s request the cases were adjourned on 7 October 2008 pending the decision of the Court of Appeal in HH (Somalia), AM (Somalia), J (Somalia) and MA (Somalia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 426. The adjournment was lifted when the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment on 23 April 2010.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed further observations in October 2010.\n\nThe Chamber decided to join the applications (Rule 42 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.\n\nA. The first applicant\n\nThe first applicant, Mr Abdisamad Adow Sufi, is a Somali national who was born in 1987 and is currently in detention in an Immigration Detention Centre in West Drayton.\n\nOn 30 September 2003 he entered the United Kingdom clandestinely using false travel documents. On 3 October 2003 he claimed asylum on the ground that as a member of the Reer-Hamar, a sub-clan of the minority Ahansi clan, he had been subjected to persecution by Hawiye militia, who had killed his father and sister and seriously injured him. As a consequence, he had no surviving relatives in Somalia.\n\nOn 15 April 2005 the Secretary of State for the Home Department refused the first applicant\u2019s asylum application, finding, inter alia, that the fact he had remained in Somalia until 2003 undermined his claim to be a member of a minority clan. On 16 May 2005 he appealed against the refusal of the application on both asylum and human rights grounds, namely Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention. On 29 June 2005 both the asylum appeal and the human rights appeal were dismissed by an Adjudicator who found that his account of what had happened to him in Somalia was not credible.\n\nOn 7 October 2005 the first applicant pleaded guilty to two offences of burglary, five offences of dishonestly obtaining goods by deception and one offence of attempting to dishonestly obtain goods by deception. On 29 November 2005 he was sentenced to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. On 14 February 2006 he was convicted, inter alia, of threats to kill and was sentenced to a further six months\u2019 detention at a Young Offender Institution. He was later sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment following a conviction for indecent exposure in October 2007 and to thirty-two months\u2019 imprisonment following a conviction for five counts of burglary and theft and two counts of attempted burglary in July 2009.\n\nOn 15 July 2006 the first applicant was served with a decision to make a deportation order, in which the Secretary of State noted the seriousness of his offences and the need to protect the public from serious crime and its effects. He also noted that he was 19 years of age, in good health and single. Although he had been resident in the United Kingdom for almost two years, he had spent his youth and formative years in Somalia. In the circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to expect him to readjust to life there. The Secretary of State for the Home Department also considered Article 8 of the Convention but concluded that the first applicant\u2019s deportation would not constitute a disproportionate interference with his right to respect for his family and private life.\n\nOn 4 September 2006 his appeal against the Secretary of State\u2019s decision was rejected by an Immigration Judge. On 1 November 2006 a deportation order against the first applicant was signed and an application for judicial review of the deportation decision was refused in January 2007.\n\nOn 27 February 2007 the Court granted the first applicant interim measures under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court to prevent his removal to Somalia prior to the Court\u2019s consideration of his application.\n\nB. The second applicant\n\nThe second applicant, Mr Abdiaziz Ibrahim Elmi, is a Somali national who was born in 1969 and is currently detained in an Immigration Detention Centre.\n\nHe was born in Hargeisa, which is now the capital of the self\u2011declared state of Somaliland. When he was two years of age, his family moved to Mogadishu and he never returned to the north of the country.\n\nHis father, a high-ranking officer in the army during the Barr\u00e9 regime, was appointed to the Somali Embassy in London as a military attach\u00e9 in 1988. The second applicant joined him in the United Kingdom on 18 October 1988 and was given six months\u2019 leave to enter. On 1 March 1989 his father died. On 26 April 1989 the second applicant made an application for asylum based on his father\u2019s position in the Somali army and the beginning of the civil war in Somalia. On 31 October 1989 he was recognised as a refugee and granted leave to remain until 31 October 1993. On 7 January 1994 he was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe second applicant was convicted of a road traffic offence in June 1992. On 8 March 1996 he was sentenced to a total of five years and six months\u2019 imprisonment by a Crown Court for handling stolen goods, obtaining property by deception, robbery and possessing an imitation firearm while committing an offence. On 13 November 2000 he was convicted of perverting the course of justice and sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment. In the same year he was convicted on further counts of theft and road traffic offences. On 16 March 2001 he was convicted of theft by a Magistrates\u2019 Court and placed on a curfew. On 7 June 2001 he was again convicted of theft and sentenced to 3 months\u2019 imprisonment. On 23 May 2002 he was convicted by a Crown Court on eight counts of supplying class A drugs (cocaine and heroin) and on 7 November 2002 he was sentenced to 42 months\u2019 imprisonment. On an unspecified date the second applicant was released on licence. On 21 June 2004 he was sentenced to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment by a Crown Court for burglary and theft.\n\nOn 21 June 2006 a decision was made to issue a deportation order by virtue of section 3(5) of the Immigration Act 1971 and the second applicant was invited to rebut the presumption that his continued presence in the United Kingdom constituted a danger to the community.\n\nHe accepted that he was a drug addict but submitted that he did not constitute a danger to the community because he had made efforts to overcome his addiction and had recognised his past wrongdoings. However, on 4 September 2006 the Secretary of State for the Home Department found that he had failed to demonstrate that he would not constitute such a danger. In respect of his rights under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, the Secretary of State found that even though he had been living in the United Kingdom and could be identified as such he would not be at risk on return to Somalia as he was a member of the Isaaq, a majority clan. In respect of his rights under Article 8 of the Convention, the Secretary of State accepted that he had family ties with his three sisters and his mother in the United Kingdom but did not consider that these relationships constituted family life for the purposes of Article 8 as there was no evidence of dependency going beyond the normal emotional ties. The Secretary of State therefore concluded that his removal would not violate Articles 2, 3 or 8 of the Convention.\n\nOn 27 October 2006 the second applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State for the Home Department was refused by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (\u201cAIT\u201d), which considered that he could obtain clan protection in any part of Somalia as he was a member of a majority clan. Although the AIT accepted that he would not find support in relation to his drug dependency in Somalia, it found that this did not suffice to rebut the presumption in favour of deportation. As to his Article 8 claim, the second applicant had not shown that family life existed amongst his adult siblings and, even if it did, he had not shown that his circumstances were \u201ctruly exceptional so that his removal would violate his Article 8 rights\u201d. Finally, the AIT noted that the sale of drugs posed a danger to the community and there was a real likelihood of the second applicant re\u2011offending.\n\nA deportation order against the second applicant was signed on 8 January 2007 and on 6 March 2007 he was served with removal directions. On 14 March 2007 he requested, and was granted, interim measures under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court to prevent his removal before his application was considered by the Court.\n\nOn 3 March 2008 the second applicant was convicted of possession of a Class A controlled drug with intent to supply and was sentenced to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment. On 8 July 2010 he was again charged with possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply. A hearing has not yet taken place.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 27961/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Tony Booth (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 25 October 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Royds Rdw, solicitors in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant complained under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, because he was a man, he was denied social security benefits equivalent to those received by widows.\n\nOn 17 November 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning widows\u2019 benefits. Subsequently, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Sussex.\n\nHis wife died on 29 October 2000. They had no children from the marriage. His claim for widows\u2019 benefits was made on 2 January 2001 and was rejected on 31 May 2001 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows\u2019 benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 42711/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr St John Edward Mitchard (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 18 March 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Royds Rdw, solicitors in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant complained under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, because he was a man, he was denied social security benefits equivalent to those received by widows.\n\nOn 8 April 2003 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning widows\u2019 benefits relating to the period after the date on which the applicant lodged his relevant claim and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. Subsequently, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Oxford.\n\nHis wife died on 12 October 1996 leaving dependent children. His claim for widows\u2019 benefits was made in March 2001 and on 2 May 2001 it was determined that he was entitled to Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance as from 10 April 2001. The applicant however requested that the claim be treated as from the date of his wife\u2019s death, or alternatively that he be allowed to claim the equivalent widow\u2019s benefit. On 22 October he made a formal application for widow\u2019s benefit which was rejected on 27 February 2002 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows\u2019 benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 2895/07) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr John Blackgrove (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 21 December 2006.\n\nThe United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nBy a decision of 4 September 2008 the President of the Fourth Section of the Court decided to communicate the application. Subsequently, under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Kent.\n\nThe applicant and his wife had two children, born in 1982 and 1987. The applicant\u2019s wife died on 2 June 1999.\n\nOn 5 October 2000 the applicant applied to the Benefits Agency for the payment of social security benefits. He applied for benefits equivalent to those which a widow, whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of his wife, would have been entitled, namely a Widow\u2019s Payment (\u201cWpt\u201d) and a Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance (\u201cWMA\u201d), payable under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cthe 1992 Act\u201d). On 17 October 2000 his application was rejected as these benefits were only available to women. This decision was reconsidered without alteration on 25 October 2000.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Social Security Tribunal on 10 July 2001 and again his claim was rejected. In November 2001 the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the Appeal Commissioner. Eventually permission was granted but his appeal was again rejected on 28 May 2004. The applicant again appealed to the Commissioner who rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal on 13 December 2006.\n\nFinally, the applicant submitted an appeal to the Court of Appeal (Civil Division), which was refused on 16 March 2007.\n\nAt the time of his claim in 2000 the applicant was in receipt of child benefit.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 75362/01) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a United Kingdom national, Mr Egon von B\u00fclow (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 24 July 2001.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Messrs Atter McKenzie, solicitors practising in Evesham. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Evans of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant alleged that he had not had a proper review of the lawfulness of his continued detention as a mandatory life prisoner, invoking Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 2 July 2002, the Court declared the case partly inadmissible and adjourned the remainder for observations of the Government. By decision of 6 May 2003, the Court declared the remainder of the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant, but not the Government, filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 3 in fine).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, Mr Egon von B\u00fclow, is a United Kingdom national, who was born in 1946 and is currently serving a sentence of life imprisonment at HM Prison Erlestoke.\n\nThe applicant was convicted in 1975 for the murder of a policeman and attempted murder of two other policemen arising out of an incident in the early hours of 6 July 1974 when, on being stopped by the police, he had pulled out a pistol and shot all three officers. He was sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment for the murder and to two concurrent terms of fifteen years imprisonment for the attempted murders.\n\nAfter his trial, the trial judge recommended that he serve a tariff (minimum period of detention representing the elements of retribution and deterrence) of 20 years. The Lord Chief Justice agreed. The Secretary of State did not set a tariff.\n\nBy letter dated 25 July 2000, the applicant was informed that the Secretary of State had given fresh consideration to the tariff in his case. The letter stated that the Secretary of State had decided to set the tariff at 23 years and that, as this period had expired, the tariff was no longer a factor in the applicant\u2019s continued detention.\n\nBy letter dated 27 March 2001, the applicant was informed that the Parole Board had not recommended his release. Though some improvement had been observed, it was noted that the reports on the applicant agreed that he still had some way to go before a move to open conditions could be contemplated. As his progress in a category C prison had been encouraging however, his next review was set to commence on March 2002.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 37212/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Timothy Walker (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 17 October 2001.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr A. Gask, a lawyer working for Liberty, London. The British Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant alleged that the obligation imposed on him as a man in employment over age 60 to pay national insurance contributions, which did not apply to a woman in work of over that age, was in violation of Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 16 March 2004, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 3 in fine).\n\nFollowing the judgment of the Grand Chamber in Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, 12 April 2006), the applicant and the Government submitted further observations.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Shipston Stour, Warwickshire.\n\nUnder current United Kingdom law, the state pension age is 65 for men and 60 for women. Until these ages, men and women who work are required to pay national insurance contributions (\u201cNICs\u201d) if their earnings are above a threshold amount, currently 385 pounds sterling (GBP) per month.\n\nThe applicant is over 60 years old and works as an administrator. Since he has not reached the state pension age for men of 65, he is required to pay NICs on his earnings. At the time of introduction of the application, his monthly salary was GBP 2,970 and he paid 10% of his earnings (between the primary threshold of GBP 385 and the upper earnings limit of GBP 2,535) in NICs (Class 1), amounting to GBP 215 per month and GBP 2,580 per annum. From April 2003, NICs increased to 11% of the amount up to the upper earnings limit, plus an additional 1% on all earnings above the limit. The applicant\u2019s NICs increased to GBP 241.34 per month.\n\nThe applicant will be required to pay national insurance contributions from his earnings until he reaches the age of 65.\n\nA woman of 60 years or more who continued to work would not be required to pay any NICs on her earnings.\n\nThe applicant wrote to his Member of Parliament and the Paymaster General complaining about the difference in treatment for men and women. Both replied stating that since liability to pay national insurance contributions is linked to the state pension age, the treatment of men and women would equalise in 2020 when the state pension age will equalise.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 65723/01) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by Mr John Goodwin (\u201cthe applicant\u201d) on 12 December 2000.\n\nThe applicant was unrepresented. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to grant him Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance or equivalent constituted discrimination on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nBy a partial decision of 4 December 2001 the Court decided to communicate this application. It also decided to join this application to other applications (nos. 60525/00, 60933/00, 60937/00, 60944/00, 61038/00, 61388/00, 61949/00, 62776/00 63388/00, 63464/00, 63469/00, 63470/00, 63473/00, 63474/00, 63584/00, 63645/00, 63701/00, 63702/00 and 64735/01).\n\nOn 26 August 2003, after obtaining the parties\u2019 observations, the Court declared the application admissible in so far as the complaint concerned Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Solihull.\n\nHis wife died on 23 March 1999. On 16 September 2000 the applicant made a claim to the Inland Revenue requesting an allowance equivalent to that received by a widow, namely Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance (\u201cWBA\u201d), for the years 1998/99 and 1999/2000. On 29 September 2000 the Inland Revenue informed him that he was ineligible for WBA as he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such benefit was payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.",

Starling, a solicitor practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant complained under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that, because he was a man, he was denied social security benefits equivalent to those received by widows.\n\nOn 11 May 1999 the Court decided to communicate this application.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Gloucestershire.\n\nHis wife died in March 1998, leaving two children born in 1984 and 1988. His claim for widows' benefits was made on 14 March 1998 and was rejected on 15 September 1998 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows' benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.\n\nCOMPLAINTS\n\nThe applicant complained that British social security legislation discriminated against him on grounds of sex, in breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with both Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.",

On 23 May 2000 he was informed that his claim could not be accepted because there was no basis in domestic law allowing widowers to claim this benefit. The applicant was advised that an appeal against this decision would be bound to fail.\n\nThe applicant received child benefit in the sum of GBP 100 per month.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 12895/02) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by Mr William Crilly (\u201cthe applicant\u201d) on 26 September 2000.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr John Savage a financial accountant practising in Cornwall. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities' refusal to grant him Widow's Bereavement Allowance or equivalent constituted discrimination on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nBy a partial decision of 30 April 2002 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning Widow's Bereavement Allowance and declared inadmissible the remainder of the application. By a decision of 4 November 2003 the Court declared the remainder of the application admissible.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Devon.\n\nHis wife died on 10 March 1997. On 24 February 2000 the applicant's representative made a claim on behalf of the applicant to the Inland Revenue, requesting an allowance equivalent to that received by a widow, namely Widow's Bereavement Allowance (\u201cWBA\u201d) for the years 1996/7 and 1997/8. On 13 March 2000 the Inland Revenue informed him that he was ineligible for WBA as he was not a woman. The applicant's representative replied by letter on 16 March 2000 and again on 4 August 2000 arguing that the refusal was discriminatory. The Inland Revenue responded on 11 August 2000, maintaining its decision to refuse the allowance. The applicant's representative wrote also to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on whose behalf the Personal Tax Division of the Inland Revenue replied on 19 September 2000, confirming that the applicant, as a man, was not entitled to WBA. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such benefit was payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 41534/98) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Brian Bell (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 22 May 1998.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr J. Mackenzie, a lawyer practising in Oxfordshire. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agents, Mr C.A. Whomersley and, subsequently, Mr J. Grainger, both of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe case concerned proceedings before his Commanding Officer (\u201cCO\u201d). He complained under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 that his CO lacked independence and impartiality, that those proceedings were consequently unfair, that the trial was not \u201cpublic\u201d, that his CO did not constitute a tribunal \u201cestablished by law\u201d and that he had no legal representation.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nBy a decision of 15 November 2005, a Chamber of the Fourth Section of the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nThe Government, but not the applicant, filed further written observations (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 3 in fine).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1973 and lived in Surrey.\n\nAt the time of the events in question, he was a soldier serving as a Private with the Grenadier Guards of the British Army, stationed at Alexandra Barracks in Northern Ireland.\n\nOn the evening of 19 December 1997 the applicant was talking with an officer, Captain J, in the foyer of the cookhouse at the barracks. There followed an exchange of words between the applicant and a non-commissioned officer, Sergeant H, who subsequently ordered another non-commissioned officer, Corporal G, to have the applicant locked up overnight. The applicant was not told the offence of which he was accused, but on his arrival at the guardroom he overheard Sergeant H tell the Guard Commander that he had seen the applicant with a bleeding nose and that, when he asked the applicant about it, the latter had told him to \u201cfuck off\u201d.\n\nThe applicant was released the following morning and went to the medical centre. He submitted that his examination established that he had not had a nose bleed the night before.\n\nOn 22 December 1997 at approximately 2 p.m. the applicant was informed that he would have to appear before his company commander. At approximately 4 p.m. he appeared before his company commander, who, in connection with the events of 19 December, charged the applicant with the offence of using insubordinate language to a superior contrary to section 33(1)(b) of the Army Act 1955 and informed the applicant that the case would be heard the following day by the battalion commanding officer (\u201cCO\u201d). He informed the applicant of the facts alleged against him.\n\nThe applicant claimed that he then went to the medical centre and asked for a record of his examination establishing that he had not had a nose bleed on the night in question. He claimed that staff at the medical centre refused to provide the record and the Government disputed this.\n\nThe applicant accepted that he received a version of the information pamphlet entitled \u201cRights of a Soldier charged with an offence under the Army Act 1955\u201d, although he claimed that it was the pre-October 1997 version and thus out of date.\n\nOn the morning of 23 December 1997 the applicant was asked if he had any witnesses to call at the hearing before the CO. He asked that Captain J and Corporal G be called to give evidence on his behalf. When the applicant arrived at the Regimental Offices later that morning he saw Corporal G being called into the Regimental Sergeant Major\u2019s office. The applicant claimed that Corporal G had been directed not to give evidence in support of his case. The Government argued that it was routine for witnesses to be called into the Regimental Sergeant Major\u2019s office so that the procedure to be followed at the hearing could be explained and they denied that Corporal G had been directed as the applicant alleged or at all.\n\nThe applicant appeared before the CO at 10.30 a.m. on 23 December 1997. The hearing lasted approximately ten minutes. Present in the CO\u2019s office for the hearing were the CO, the battalion adjutant, the regimental sergeant major, Sergeant H and the \u201caccused adviser\u201d, an officer appointed to look after the applicant\u2019s interests, whose identity remained unknown to the applicant and with whom he had not discussed his case. That officer did not speak at any point during the hearing. The applicant was required to stand to attention throughout the hearing and was permitted to speak only when invited to do so by the CO.\n\nThe CO asked Sergeant H to give his evidence. The latter said that he had seen the applicant in the foyer of the cookhouse on the relevant evening and that his nose had been bleeding. When he had asked the applicant about his nose bleed, he had replied: \u201cFuck off, it\u2019s nothing to do with you\u201d.\n\nThe CO then asked the applicant if he admitted the offence described and the applicant pleaded not guilty. The CO asked him to give his evidence and he said that he had been speaking to Captain J when Sergeant H had ordered him to go to bed. The applicant had said to Sergeant H that he was speaking to Captain J, but Sergeant H had then ordered Corporal G to lock him up. The CO asked the applicant if he had any evidence to call and the applicant asked to call Captain J. The latter said that he had been speaking to the applicant in the foyer of the cookhouse and had not heard him swear at Sergeant H. The applicant claimed that, at this point, Sergeant H interrupted Captain J\u2019s evidence saying that he did not think the Captain could have heard anything as the exchange in question had taken place outside the cookhouse. The Government denied any such interruption. The applicant further alleged that Captain J responded to Sergeant H: \u201cIn which case I would not have heard it\u201d. Corporal G did not give evidence.\n\nThe CO asked the applicant if he wished to elect trial by court-martial, but the applicant said that he would accept the CO\u2019s award. The company commander, who was present by this time, said that the applicant was a satisfactory member of his company. The CO then said that he found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to seven days\u2019 detention and seven days\u2019 associated loss of pay. The applicant served his sentence in a locked cell in the battalion guardroom.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 44306/98) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by three United Kingdom nationals, Mrs Eileen Appleby, Mrs Pamela Beresford and Mr Robert Alphonsus, and an environmental group, Washington First Forum, (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 1 September 1998.\n\nThe applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented by Mr J. Welch, a lawyer working for Liberty in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley.\n\nThe applicants alleged that they had been prevented from meeting in the town centre, a privately owned shopping mall, to impart information and ideas about proposed local development plans. They relied on Articles 10, 11 and 13 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court).\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nA hearing on admissibility and the merits took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 15 October 2002 (Rule 54 \u00a7 3). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr C. Whomersley, Agent, Mr J. Crow, Counsel, Mrs J.-A. Mackenzie, Adviser; (b) for the applicants Mr R. Singh QC, Mr A. Sharland, Counsel, Ms J. Sawyer, Adviser. The applicants Mrs Appleby and Mrs Beresford were also present. The Court heard addresses by Mr Crow and Mr Singh.\n\nBy a decision of 12 November 2002, the Chamber declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicants made submissions on just satisfaction to which the Government replied.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe first, second and third applicants were born in 1952, 1966 and 1947 respectively and live in Washington (Tyne and Wear), where the fourth applicant, an environmental group set up by the applicants, is also based.\n\nThe new town centre of Washington is known as \u201cthe Galleries\u201d and is located within an area now owned by Postel Properties Limited (\u201cPostel\u201d), a private company. This town centre was originally built by the Washington Development Corporation (\u201cthe Corporation\u201d), a body set up by the government of the United Kingdom pursuant to an Act of Parliament to build the \u201cnew\u201d centre. The centre was sold to Postel on 30 December 1987.\n\nThe Galleries, as owned by Postel at the relevant time, comprised a shopping mall (with two hypermarkets and major shops), the surrounding car parks with spaces for approximately 3,000 cars and walkways. Public services were also available in the vicinity. However, the freehold of the careers\u2019 office and the public library was owned by the Council, the social services office and health centre were leased to the Council by the Secretary of State and the freehold of the police station was held on behalf of Northumbria Police Authority. There was a post office within the Galleries and also the offices of the housing department, leased to the Council by Postel.\n\nAround September 1997 the Council gave outline planning permission to the City of Sunderland College to build on a part of Princess Anne Park in Washington known as the Arena. The Arena is the only playing field in the vicinity of Washington town centre which is available for use by the local community. The first to third applicants, together with other concerned residents, formed the fourth applicant to campaign against the college\u2019s proposal and to persuade the Council not to grant the college permission to build on the field.\n\nOn or around 14 March 1998 the first applicant, together with her husband and son, set up two stands at the entrance of the shopping mall in the Galleries, displaying posters alerting the public to the likely loss of the open space and seeking signatures to present to the Council on behalf of Washington First Forum. Security guards employed by Postel would not let the first applicant or her assistants continue to collect signatures on any land or premises owned by Postel. The applicants had to remove their stands and stop collecting signatures.\n\nThe manager of one of the hypermarkets gave the applicants permission to set up stands within that store in March 1998, allowing them to transmit their message and to collect signatures, albeit from a reduced number of people. However, the same permission was not granted in April 1998 when the applicants wanted to collect signatures for a further petition.\n\nOn 10 April 1998 the third applicant, as acting chair of Washington First Forum, wrote to the manager of the Galleries asking for permission to set up a stand and to canvass views from the public either inside the mall itself or in the adjacent car parks and offered to pay to be allowed to do so. In his reply of 14 April 1998, the manager of the Galleries refused access. His letter read as follows: \u201c... the Galleries is unique in as much as although it is the Town Centre, it is also privately owned. The owner\u2019s stance on all political and religious issues, is one of strict neutrality and I am charged with applying this philosophy. I am therefore obliged to refuse permission for you to carry out a petition within the Galleries or the adjacent car parks.\u201d\n\nOn 19 April 1998 the third applicant wrote again to the manager of the Galleries, asking him to reconsider his decision. His letter remained unanswered.\n\nThe fourth applicant continued to try and reach the public by setting up stands by the roadside on public footpaths and going to the old town centre at Concord which, however, is visited by a much smaller number of Washington residents.\n\nThe deadline for letters of representation to the Council regarding the building works was 1 May 1998. On 30 April 1998 the applicants submitted the 3,200 letters of representation they had obtained.\n\nThe fourth applicant has produced a list of associations and others which were given permission to carry out collections, set up stands and displays within the Galleries. These included: the Salvation Army (collection before Christmas), local school choirs (carol-singing and collection before Christmas), the Stop Smoking Campaign (advertising display and handing out of nicotine patches), the Blood Transfusion Service (blood collection), the Royal British Legion (collection for Armistice Day), various photographers (advertising and taking of photographs) and British Gas (staffed advertising display).\n\nFrom 31 January to 6 March 2001, Sunderland Council ran a consultation campaign under the banner \u201cYour Council, Your Choice\u201d, informing the local residents of three leadership choices for the future of the Council and were allowed to use the Galleries for this purpose. This was a statutory consultation exercise carried out under section 25 of the Local Government Act 2000, which required local authorities to draw up proposals for the operation of \u201cexecutive arrangements\u201d and consult local electors before sending them to the Secretary of State. Some 8,500 people were reported as having responded to the survey.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 28212/95) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two United Kingdom nationals, Patrick Benjamin and Hueth Wilson, on 3 August 1995.\n\nThe applicants, who had been granted legal aid, were represented before the Court by Ms L. Scott-Moncrieff, a lawyer practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Huw Llewellyn of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicants, who were detained in hospital following sentence by courts to terms of discretionary life imprisonment, alleged that they had not had available to them a procedure by which they could challenge the lawfulness of their continued detention, invoking Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was declared admissible by the Commission on 23 October 1997 and transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998 in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 3, second sentence, of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, the Commission not having completed its examination of the case by that date.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court. Sir Nicolas Bratza, the judge elected in respect of the United Kingdom, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Sir Scott Baker to sit as an ad hoc judge in his place (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 2 in fine).\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. The first applicant\n\nThe first applicant, Mr Patrick Benjamin, was sentenced to life imprisonment for rape in 1983. His tariff period (the minimum period of detention satisfying the requirements of retribution and deterrence) was set at six years and expired in April 1989. His time in prison was characterised by periods of thought disorder, delusions and behavioural problems and the Secretary of State decided that he was in need of care and treatment in a secure hospital. In August 1989, he was made the subject of a transfer direction and a restriction order under, respectively, sections 47 and 49 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (the 1983 Act) and transferred to Broadmoor Special Hospital.\n\nIn October 1993, the Secretary of State decided, following consultation with the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice, that the first applicant should be regarded as a \u201ctechnical lifer\u201d (that is a person who was suffering from a mental disorder which influenced him to a significant extent at the time of the offence although the court had not made a hospital order on sentencing).\n\nIn April 1994, the first applicant was transferred to Bracton Clinic Regional Secure Unit. On 1 July 1996, his case for discharge was considered by the Mental Health Review Tribunal which found that it was not satisfied that the first applicant did not any longer require treatment in a hospital for mental illness.\n\nWhen his case was reviewed most recently, on 9 January 2001, the MHR Tribunal recommended his discharge. The Secretary of State accepted the recommendation and the first applicant was discharged.\n\nB. The second applicant\n\nThe second applicant, Mr Hueth Wilson, was sentenced to life imprisonment for buggery of a young girl in 1977. The court had before it psychiatric evidence to the effect that he suffered from mental illness. Expert psychiatric evidence recommended that he should be made subject to a hospital order coupled with a restriction order without limit of time under sections 37 and 41 of the Mental Health Act 1959. Due to an absence of any beds in hospitals providing the level of security that the trial judge considered necessary, the judge felt unable to make the orders and passed, instead, a discretionary life sentence. The judge commented that the second applicant could later be transferred to hospital if his condition required it. His tariff period was set at eight years and expired in 1984.\n\nIn August 1977, the second applicant was transferred to hospital under the Mental Health Act 1959 (later replaced by the 1983 Act). In November 1977, the applicant returned to prison and there were several other transfers to and from hospital in subsequent years. In October 1992, the second applicant was transferred to Rampton Special Hospital under sections 47 and 49 of the 1983 Act. In June 1993, following consultation with the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice, the Secretary of State decided that the second applicant should be regarded as a \u201ctechnical lifer\u201d.\n\nOn 6 July 1996 the MHR Tribunal considered the second applicant's case for discharge and found that they were not satisfied that he no longer required treatment in hospital for mental illness. His case was reviewed most recently on 13 June 2000 when the Tribunal again did not recommend discharge.\n\nC. Domestic proceedings concerning the applicants' status\n\nBy decisions of the Secretary of State for the Home Department communicated to the applicants in October and November 1992, the Secretary of State refused to certify the applicants as eligible for review by the discretionary lifer panels empowered by section 34 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 to order their release on licence. Leave to apply for judicial review of the decisions was granted on 17 May 1993.\n\nOn 22 October 1993 the High Court, granting the application, made a declaration that the Secretary of State's policy not to certify discretionary life prisoners under paragraph 9 of Schedule 12 to the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (\u201cthe 1991 Act\u201d) on the ground that they had been transferred to hospital under the 1983 Act was unlawful ([1994] Q.B. 378).\n\nOn appeal, on 19 July 1994, the Court of Appeal reversed the High Court's decision in part. It considered that, although the applicants were existing life prisoners within the meaning of the paragraph 9 of Schedule 12, their discharge nevertheless remained subject to the procedure laid down in section 50 of the 1983 Act. The rights to a hearing under the 1991 Act were conferred only on persons who were solely subject to that Act, and not on those who were mental patients ([1995] Q.B. 43).\n\nThe applicants were informed by letter of 18 May 1995 that the House of Lords had refused leave to appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 38978/97) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Swedish national, Hans Salomonsson (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 15 September 1997.\n\nThe applicant was until 31 May 2000 represented by Mr G. Antal and thereafter by Mr U. Jacobson, both lawyers practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Jagander, Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his rights under Article 6 of the Convention had been violated on account of the lack of an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court in proceedings concerning social security benefits.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 4 May 2000 the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nOn 17 October 1994 the applicant, who was born in 1937 and had been on early retirement since 1989, applied for disability benefits under the Social Insurance Act (Lagen om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring, 1962:381; hereinafter \u201cthe 1962 Act\u201d). He claimed that he had extra costs following an operation on his intestines in September 1994 due to, inter alia, an increased consumption of fluids.\n\nBy a decision of 28 December 1994 the Social Insurance Office (f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan; hereinafter \u201cthe Office\u201d) of the County of Stockholm rejected the application, finding that the applicant\u2019s costs were not such as to make him eligible for benefits.\n\nThe applicant later made a new application, which was rejected by the Office on 8 February 1995.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court (l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten) of the County of Stockholm. On 16 May 1995 the court rejected his appeal. The court did not hold an oral hearing nor did the applicant request one.\n\nFollowing the applicant\u2019s further appeal, the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarr\u00e4tten) in Stockholm, by a decision of 17 November 1995, refused him leave to appeal.\n\nOn 5 December 1995 the applicant made yet another application for disability benefits. On 3 April 1996 the application was rejected by the Office, which again found that the applicant\u2019s costs did not attain the required level. The Office had at its disposal three medical certificates issued by different physicians. They expressed differing opinions on the applicant\u2019s need of extra consumption of fluids, two of them considering that there was no such need and the third one stating that the applicant was recommended, from a surgical point of view, an increased consumption of, for instance, mineral water.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court. In a decision of 23 July 1996 the court noted that the issue in the case was whether the applicant\u2019s extra costs attained the level required for a disability allowance under the 1962 Act. Finding that the medical evidence in the case was inconclusive and did not provide the Court with a sufficient basis for a decision, the court ordered the National Social Insurance Board (Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket; hereinafter \u201cthe Board\u201d) to submit observations in the case. The Board answered by a letter of 13 August 1996, in which it contested the applicant\u2019s claims. The applicant made observations in reply.\n\nOn 16 October 1996 the County Administrative Court gave judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour. Having reiterated that the medical evidence was inconclusive, the court also noted that the calculations of the applicant\u2019s extra costs made by the Office and the applicant himself were very close on either side of the level required for entitlement to a disability allowance. In these circumstances, it gave the applicant the benefit of the doubt and granted him an allowance. An oral hearing was not requested by the applicant, nor did the court hold one of its own motion.\n\nThe Board appealed against the judgment to the Administrative Court of Appeal and submitted a medical certificate from a further physician, who stated that an increased consumption of fluids was necessary due to the applicant\u2019s handicap but that there was no particular need for mineral water. On 2 April 1997 the appellate court granted the Board leave to appeal.\n\nBy a letter of 23 April 1997 the applicant requested the appellate court to hold an oral hearing in the case. He did not state any reasons for his request. On 15 May 1997 it was rejected by the court. After having restated section 9 of the Administrative Court Procedure Act (F\u00f6rvaltningsprocess-lagen, 1971:291; hereinafter \u201cthe 1971 Act\u201d; see further paragraph 25 below), the court gave the following reasons: \u201cHaving regard to the subject-matter at issue and the information that has come to hand in the case, [the court] finds that an oral hearing is unnecessary and rejects the request to that effect. [The applicant] is invited to state the further circumstances he wishes to invoke and submit his final written observations in the case within two weeks after having been notified of this decision. The case can be determined notwithstanding a failure to submit such written observations.\u201d\n\nThe applicant reiterated his request for an oral hearing on 22 May 1997. He now stated that he wished to be heard in person about his working conditions and the costs of his consumption of fluids. Further, representatives of the Board should be heard about the applicable levels for entitlement to and calculation of disability allowances.\n\nOn 24 June 1997 the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant\u2019s renewed request for an oral hearing and gave judgment in favour of the Board. Thus, it quashed the County Administrative Court\u2019s judgment and confirmed the Office\u2019s decision of 3 April 1996. Without giving any further reasons, it considered that the information in the case did not show that the applicant met the conditions for a disability allowance.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten). He requested that the case be referred back to the Administrative Court of Appeal for re-examination or, alternatively, that the Supreme Administrative Court confirm the County Administrative Court\u2019s judgment. He complained about the lack of an oral hearing in the Administrative Court of Appeal and also requested the Supreme Administrative Court to hold an oral hearing.\n\nBy a letter of 28 July 1997 the Supreme Administrative Court informed the applicant that it did not normally hold oral hearings and gave him the opportunity to complete his appeal in writing.\n\nOn 26 August 1997 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36887/97) against Ireland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by an Irish national, Mr Paul Quinn (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 6 March 1997.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr M. Farrell, a lawyer practising in Dublin. The Irish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented successively by their Agents, Ms E. Kilcullen, Mr R. Siev and Dr A. Connolly, all of the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 constituted a violation of the rights guaranteed by Articles 6, 10 and 13 of the Convention.\n\nOn 1 July 1998 the Commission decided to communicate to the Government the applicant\u2019s complaints under Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention. The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr Hedigan, the judge elected in respect of Ireland, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Ms Vaji\u0107, the judge elected in respect of Croatia, to sit in his place (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nBy a decision of 21 September 1999, the Court declared admissible the applicant\u2019s complaints under Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). The Court decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 2 in fine) and the parties replied in writing to each other\u2019s observations on the merits.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nOn 7 June 1996, at approximately 6.00 a.m., two detective police officers left Limerick city in an unmarked police car escorting a post office van carrying significant sums of money on its way to Adare village, Co. Limerick. When the two vehicles arrived at the post office in Adare, the police car was rammed from behind by a stolen vehicle and immediately surrounded by five heavily armed and masked individuals dressed in paramilitary style uniforms. One of the five opened fire at point blank range on the police officers. One of those officers died instantly and the other was seriously wounded.\n\nThe police suspected a local unit of the Irish Republican Army (an unlawful paramilitary organisation known as the IRA) and the IRA later claimed responsibility for the murder. It was also suspected by the police that, on the night prior to the attack in Adare, the stolen vehicle together with all firearms and ammunition used in the attempted robbery had been stored in a safe house in Patrickswell, Co. Limerick. As part of the investigation that followed, a number of persons suspected of being members of the local unit of the IRA were arrested and charged, including the applicant\u2019s brother who was charged with conspiracy to commit robbery (in relation to the Adare incident), possession of ammunition and of membership of the IRA. A total of 63 persons were arrested and asked to account for their movements at particular times surrounding the attack, including the remaining members of the applicant\u2019s family except his two sisters. All of those persons who were asked to account for their movements did so.\n\nOn 19 July 1996 at 9.30 a.m. the applicant, who resided in the family home in Patrickswell, Co. Limerick, was arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 (\u201cthe 1939 Act\u201c) on suspicion of being a member of the IRA contrary to section 21 of the 1939 Act.\n\nHe was questioned on eight occasions during two 24-hour consecutive periods of detention for which provision is made under section 30 of the 1939 Act. While in detention, he saw his solicitor on three occasions: between 11.12 a.m. and 11.36 a.m. on 19 July 1996 prior to his first interview with the police; between 5.54 p.m. and 6.27 p.m. on 19 July 1996 and between 1.28 p.m. and 2.00 p.m. on 20 July 1996. That solicitor did not attend the applicant\u2019s interviews with the police.\n\nAt the beginning of the interviews, the applicant was cautioned that he was not obliged to say anything, but that anything he did say would be taken down in writing and could be given in evidence. Many of the questions put to the applicant related to the attack in Adare and to his alleged membership of the IRA. On several occasions during those interviews he was also requested to account for his movements during certain periods of time on 6 and 7 June 1996 immediately before, during and after the incident in Adare. In being so requested, he was informed by the questioning police officers that a failure to provide this information would constitute an offence under section 52 of the 1939 Act for which the potential penalty was six months\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant was also informed, on certain occasions only, that the initial caution given to him did not apply as he was obliged to respond under section 52 of the 1939 Act.\n\nThe applicant denied any connection with the events in Adare, indicated that he was in London when he heard the news of the murder and otherwise refused to give an account of his movements stating, on one occasion, that he had been advised by his solicitor not to answer questions.\n\nOn 17 January 1997 he was charged, pursuant to section 52 of the 1939 Act, on three counts of refusing to give an account of his movements. On 15 May 1997 the District Court dismissed one charge, he was convicted on the second charge (a section 52 request made on 21 July 1996) and no ruling was made on the remaining charge. The applicant was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant appealed against conviction and sentence to the Circuit Court and was released on bail pending the appeal. He appealed on the basis, inter alia, of an overlap in the times referred to in the charge which was dismissed and the charge on which he was convicted. In early October 1997 the Circuit Court rejected this part of his appeal. When the Circuit Court sat on 20 January 1998 to hear the applicant\u2019s submissions on sentence, he withdrew that portion of the appeal which was then struck out. The applicant was detained immediately to serve his prison sentence and was released on 4 June 1998.\n\nIn February 1999 the applicant\u2019s brother pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery and the remaining charges were not proceeded with. Four other men pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the detective police officer and the wounding of his colleague in Adare, Co. Limerick.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 55863/11) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr David Thomas (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 28 August 2011.\n\nThe United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Addis, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that his detention following the expiry of his tariff was unlawful in light of the failure of the authorities to put in place the necessary resources to enable him to demonstrate to the Parole Board that his risk had reduced, and that his Parole Board Review was a meaningless exercise.\n\nOn 2 September 2013 the complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 was communicated to the Government.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1968 and is currently detained in HMP North Sea Camp.\n\nOn 8 January 2008 he was convicted of attempted kidnapping. He received an indeterminate sentence for public protection (\u201cIPP sentence\u201d). A minimum term (\u201ctariff\u201d) of one year and nineteen days was fixed.\n\nIn July 2008 it was identified that the applicant was required to complete the Controlling Anger and Learning to Manage it (\u201cCALM\u201d) course to reduce his risk.\n\nOn 12 December 2008 he was transferred to HMP Stocken in order to participate in the CALM course.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s tariff expired on 26 January 2009.\n\nIn March 2009 he commenced the CALM course. He completed it on 28 May 2009.\n\nOn an unknown date he completed the Alcohol Awareness and assertiveness and decision-making courses.\n\nOn 17 February 2010 an oral hearing took place before the Parole Board to review the applicant\u2019s detention. On 26 February 2010 the Parole Board notified him that it had decided not to order his transfer to open conditions or release. It concluded that his level of risk remained incompatible with his safe management in open conditions.\n\nBy letter dated 21 June 2010 the National Offender Management Service informed the applicant that the Secretary of State agreed with the Parole Board recommendation. His review period was set at eighteen months. The review was therefore scheduled to commence in February 2011 with an oral hearing by the Parole Board in August 2011.\n\nIn September 2010 a sentence plan review took place and identified a further course, the Sex Offenders Treatment Programme (\u201cSOTP\u201d), for completion by the applicant. He had failed to admit before September 2010 that there was potentially a sexual element to his offence. Prior to commencement of the SOTP, a Structured Assessment of Risk and Need (\u201cSARN\u201d) was to be conducted.\n\nIn October 2010 the applicant complained to the prison requesting information on when the SARN would take place. On 17 November 2010 he was informed that he would have to be transferred to another prison establishment for assessment because of resource issues.\n\nOn 17 December 2010 he was moved to HMP Acklington for assessment.\n\nOn 20 January 2011 his solicitors sent a letter before claim to the governor of HMP Acklington and the Secretary of State indicating that judicial review proceedings were being considered in respect of the delay in arranging the assessment for the SOTP.\n\nOn 25 January 2011 the applicant\u2019s offender supervisor contacted a forensic psychologist in training in order to discuss the applicant\u2019s case. They agreed that an initial SOTP assessment should be completed.\n\nBy letter dated 8 February 2011 the Ministry of Justice informed the applicant that the assessment of his suitability for the SOTP would be completed by the end of February 2011. He would then be placed on a waiting list for the appropriate course.\n\nThe SOTP assessment was completed on 6 April 2011 and concluded that the applicant was motivated to engage in sex offender treatment.\n\nOn 7 April 2011 the forensic psychologist in training sought clinical guidance on the applicant\u2019s case from the Operational Services Intervention Group (OSIG\u201d). The OSIG decided that a Risk Matrix 2000 (\u201cRM2000\u201d) was required as well as a Treatment Needs Analysis (\u201cTNA\u201d) to assess the level of dynamic risk posed by the applicant.\n\nOn 23 June 2011 a forensic psychologist in training interviewed the applicant and told him that he had been referred for a TNA and RM2000. The applicant was informed that his case would be progressed over the next three months.\n\nOn 30 July 2011 the Parole Board reviewed the applicant\u2019s case on the papers. By letter dated 18 August 2011 it informed him that it had not directed his release or recommended his transfer to open conditions. It explained: \u201cThe panel is satisfied that until you have undertaken the offending behaviour work that will be identified by the forthcoming assessments and ... a full assessment has been completed of your response to treatment it will be difficult to conclude that you have addressed the core factors that caused you to offend.\u201d\n\nOn 31 August 2011 the TNA was completed.\n\nBy letter dated 28 September 2011 the National Offender Management Service informed the applicant that the Secretary of State agreed with the Parole Board recommendation. She considered that risk factors, namely sexual offending, thinking skills and behaviour and alcohol misuse, were outstanding. The letter clarified that the Secretary of State could not guarantee to place the applicant on the courses identified as there were limits on the availability of resources.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s next review was set to commence in August 2012 and be completed by April 2013. The review period was made up of, inter alia, appropriate assessments, completion of sexual offender behaviour work, participation in the post-course review and the preparation of the SARN report.\n\nAt some point he was transferred to HMP Northumberland.\n\nOn 9 November 2011 he was told by prison staff that he was on a list of prisoners being considered for the next SOTP.\n\nOn 24 November 2011 the TNA and Treatment Pathway reports were completed. The applicant was deemed suitable for the SOTP. The reports were disclosed to him on 2 December 2011.\n\nOn 22 December 2011 his solicitors wrote to the governor of HMP Northumberland requesting that immediate steps be taken to place the applicant on the next SOTP. They expressed the view that there had been no progress since the April 2011 assessment.\n\nOn 3 May 2012 the applicant commenced the SOTP. He completed the course in November 2012.\n\nA new target date of June 2013 was set to assess whether an oral Parole Board hearing ought to be held in his case. The outcome of the review is not known\n\nA SARN report was produced on 3 April 2013.\n\nOn 4 October 2013 the Secretary of State accepted the applicant\u2019s request for an exceptional transfer to open conditions. He was transferred on 5 November 2013.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 13229/03) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by an Iraqi national, Mr Shayan Baram Saadi (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 18 April 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Messrs Wilson and Co., a firm of lawyers practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Derek Walton, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant alleged that his detention at Oakington was not compatible with Articles 5 \u00a7 1 and 14 of the Convention, and that he was not given adequate reasons for it, contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 2.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 27 September 2005, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 3 in fine). The parties did not submit observations on the merits.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1976 and lives in London.\n\nThe applicant fled Iraq and arrived at London Heathrow Airport on 30 December 2000. On arrival at the immigration desk he spoke to an immigration officer and claimed asylum. He was granted \u201ctemporary admission\u201d by the immigration officer and was asked to return to the airport at 8.00 am the following morning. Overnight the applicant was permitted to stay at a hotel of his choice. On the morning of 31 December 2000 he reported as required and was again granted temporary admission until the following day, 1 January 2001 at 10.00 am. When the applicant again reported as required he was (for the third time) granted temporary admission until the following day, 2 January 2001 at 10.00 am. Again the applicant reported as required. On this occasion the applicant was detained and transferred to Oakington Reception Centre (\u201cOakington\u201d).\n\nOn 4 January 2001 the applicant was given the opportunity to consult with legal representatives. The representative telephoned the Chief Immigration Officer on 5 January, and was told that the reason for the detention was that the applicant was an Iraqi who met the criteria to be detained at Oakington. On the same day, the applicant was interviewed by an official of the Secretary of State for the Home Department [\u201cSSHD\u201d] in relation to his claim. When his asylum claim was refused on 8 January 2001 he was formally refused leave to enter the UK. The applicant submitted a notice of appeal against the asylum refusal and was released on 9 January.\n\nIn the subsequent asylum proceedings, the applicant\u2019s appeal was allowed by an adjudicator on 9 July 2001 on the ground that the Home Office had failed to specify how the applicant could be returned to the autonomous region of Iraq. The SSHD\u2019s appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal was allowed on 22 October 2001, and the case was remitted to an adjudicator. On 14 January 2003 the adjudicator found that the applicant was a refugee within the meaning of the 1951 Refugee Convention, and also that there was a real risk that his return to Iraq would expose him to treatment contrary to Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention. The applicant was subsequently granted asylum.\n\nThe applicant, together with three other Kurdish Iraqi detainees who had been held at Oakington, applied for permission for judicial review of their detention, claiming that it was unlawful under domestic law and under Article 5 of the Convention.\n\nAt first instance, Mr Justice Collins did not consider the detention to be unlawful under domestic law, essentially because he was not prepared to imply into the legislative provisions a requirement that the exercise of the power to detain had to be \u201cnecessary\u201d for the purpose of carrying out an examination of an asylum claim. He did, however, find that the detention was not compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention on the basis that once an applicant had made a proper application for asylum and there was no risk that he would abscond or otherwise misbehave, it could not be said that he needed to be detained \u201cto prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry\u201d. He also considered detention disproportionate because it could not be shown that it was reasonably necessary to the stated purpose for the detention which was the speedy examination of the asylum claim.\n\nIn connection with the reasons given for the detention, Mr Justice Collins noted that it apparently took the Home Office three months to realise that the wording of the form handed to detainees was not appropriate, and on 7 June 2000 and again on 21 December 2000 the form was under revision. As from 12 April 2001 (2 February 2001, according to the Government), a form of words was available which stated \u201cReason for Detention I have decided that you should be detained because I am satisfied that your application may be decided quickly using the fast track procedures established at Oakington Reception Centre. In reaching this decision I have taken into account that, on initial consideration, it appears that your application may be one which can be decided quickly\u201d.\n\nThat form of words was not available at the time the applicant was detained, and Collins J. regarded it as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that the form lagged behind the policy. He continued: \u201cThe form [in use at the time] clearly indicated that detention was only used where there was no reasonable alternative. All the reasons and factors reflect some possible misconduct by the detainee or the need for him to be cared for by detention ...it was wholly inappropriate for Oakington detention and it is, for example, difficult to follow what reason could conceivably have been close to fitting [the applicant\u2019s] case. Unfortunately, the copy of the [form] which should have been retained on the file has disappeared and so I do not know, nor does [the applicant] why it was said that he should be detained.\u201d\n\nThe shortcomings as to the reasons for detention did not affect the lawfulness of the detention.\n\nThe Court of Appeal upheld the SSHD\u2019s appeal on 19 October 2001, and the House of Lords dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on 31 October 2002. Both the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords held that the detention was lawful under domestic law. In connection with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), and by reference to the case of Chahal (Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V), they each held that the detention was for the purpose of deciding whether to authorise entry and that the detention did not have to be \u201cnecessary\u201d to be compatible with the provision. The detention was therefore \u201cto prevent ... unauthorised entry\u201d, and in addition was not disproportionate, Lord Slynn holding: \u201cThe need for highly structured and tightly managed arrangements, which would be disrupted by late or non-attendance of the applicant for interview, is apparent. On the other side applicants not living at Oakington, but living where they chose, would inevitably suffer considerable inconvenience if they had to be available at short notice and continuously in order to answer questions.... Getting a speedy decision is in the interest not only of the applicants but of those increasingly in the queue.\u201d",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) on 12 July 1993, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 15484/89) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 15 June 1989 by a British citizen, Mr Edward Wynne. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent him (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 25 August 1993, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc, Mr F. Matscher, Mr B. Walsh, Mr C. Russo, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha and Mr L. Wildhaber (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government of the United Kingdom (\u201cthe Government\u201c), the applicant\u2019s lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). In accordance with the order made in consequence, the Registrar received on 29 November 1993 the Government\u2019s memorial and, on 10 and 22 December 1993, the applicant\u2019s. On 27 January 1994 the applicant\u2019s submissions on Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention were received. The President consented to the filing of further written submissions by the applicant on 23 February 1994 (Rule 37 para. 1, second sub-paragraph).\n\nIn accordance with the President\u2019s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 February 1994. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr I. Christie, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Mr D. Pannick, QC, Counsel, Mr H. Carter, Home Office, Ms J. Hutcheon, Home Office, Ms H. Bayne, Home Office, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission Mr F. Mart\u00ednez, Delegate;\n\nfor the applicant Mr E. Fitzgerald, Barrister-at-law, Mr B. Emmerson, Barrister-at-law, Counsel, Mr A. Devine, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Martinez, Mr Fitzgerald and Mr Pannick.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nIn 1964 the applicant was convicted of the murder of a woman whom he had violently assaulted. He was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment. At that time the doctor who examined him found no signs of mental illness or abnormality. In May 1980 he was released on life licence after a positive recommendation by the Parole Board.\n\nIn June 1981 the applicant killed a 75 year-old woman who was placing flowers on a family grave in a London cemetery. He cut her throat with a knife. In December 1981 he pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility. This plea was accepted by the court and in January 1982 a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment was imposed (see paragraph 12 below). The trial judge considered that a life sentence was appropriate in view of the extreme danger to the public which the applicant represented. The court, at the same time, revoked his life licence under section 62 (7) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 (\u201cthe 1967 Act\u201c; see paragraphs 14 and 15 below). The applicant claims that he was informed in 1983 by prison officers at H.M. Prison Wormwood Scrubs that he was subject to the regime for discretionary life sentences.\n\nIn December 1985 the applicant was transferred to the hospital wing of Parkhurst Prison. Since then he has been transferred to Gartree Prison where he is held as a \u201cCategory A\u201c (high security) prisoner.\n\nThe applicant was considered for parole by the Parole Board in January 1989. The Board recommended that his case be referred again to the local review committee in 1994. By letter dated 14 August 1989 to the applicant\u2019s Member of Parliament, the Home Office gave the following information: \u201cIn accordance with paragraph 4 [of section 61 of the 1967 Act], the trial judge and Lord Chief Justice were consulted in September 1987. In the light of their views, it was decided that [the applicant\u2019s] case should be referred to the local review committee, as the first stage in a formal review by the Parole Board, in June 1988. The local review committee considered the case at that time [June 1988] and the Parole Board considered it in January 1989. The Board did not feel able to recommend [the applicant\u2019s] release and recommended instead that it should be referred to the local review committee (as the first stage in a further formal review) in January 1994. This recommendation was accepted and [the applicant] was informed accordingly. He should have been told in February, but owing to an oversight at Gartree I am afraid that he was not informed until last month. You will appreciate that I cannot forecast what the outcome of the next review will be or say when [the applicant] might be released. When the Parole Board consider [the applicant\u2019s] case in 1994 the tariff will have been satisfied and the question of risk will be the overriding consideration. Indeed, the Parole Board will have borne the question of risk in mind in making their recommendation as to the date of the next review. As you know, the safety of the public is paramount and no life sentence prisoner will be released if the assessment of risk is unsatisfactory, no matter how long he has been detained.\u201c\n\nHe subsequently learned that the \u201ctariff\u201c period fixed by the trial judge in respect of his second offence expired in June 1991 (see paragraph 17 below as regards the \u201ctariff\u201c period).\n\nIn a Home Office memorandum dated 5 June 1992 the applicant was informed that the \u201ctariff\u201c in respect of his conviction in 1964 had now been served and that his continued detention was based on the risk he represented.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court on 13 April 1993 by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) and on 24 May 1993 by the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden (\u201cthe Government\u201c), within the three-month period laid down in Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 18928/91) against Sweden lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swedish national, Mr Anders Fredin, on 9 April 1991. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request and of the Government\u2019s application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mrs E. Palm, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 23 April 1993 the President drew by lot, in the presence of the Registrar, the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr B. Walsh, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr I. Foighel, Sir John Freeland and Mr M. A. Lopes Rocha (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant\u2019s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant\u2019s memorial on 20 August 1993 and on 23 August 1993 a letter from the Government enclosing their written observations to the Commission dated 7 May 1992. On 10 September 1993 the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing. On 10, 15 and 21 September 1993 the Commission and the Government produced various documents, as requested by the Registrar. On the latter date the applicant submitted additional details on his claims under Article 50 (art. 50).\n\nIn accordance with the President\u2019s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 21 September 1993. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr C.H. Ehrenkrona, Assistant Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mr G. Regner, Under-Secretary, Ministry of Justice, Adviser;\n\nfor the Commission Mr S. Trechsel, Delegate;\n\nfor the applicant Mr J. Axelsson, advokat, Counsel. The Court heard addresses by Mr Ehrenkrona, Mr Trechsel and Mr Axelsson, as well as replies to a question put by it.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nMr Anders Fredin, an agricultural engineer, is a Swedish citizen. He lives at Gr\u00f6dinge, Sweden. The applicant and his wife own land in the municipality of Botkyrka, on which there is a gravel pit. They held a permit to extract gravel from the pit from 14 April 1983 until 1 December 1988, when the permit was revoked; it had previously been extended on the understanding that the activities in question would be terminated and restoration work carried out on the land by the latter date. The revocation of the permit, and the lack of a court remedy against this and a related measure, gave rise to an earlier case before the Court, which held in a judgment of 18 February 1991 (Series A no. 192) that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, but not of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) taken either alone or in conjunction with Article 14 (art. 14+P1-1) of the Convention.\n\nFollowing the revocation on 1 December 1988, the applicant applied to the County Administrative Board (l\u00e4nsstyrelsen) for a special extraction permit, so that he could comply with a plan adopted by the Board on 9 March 1987 for the restoration of the pit. The application was dismissed by the Board on 14 March 1989 and an appeal by the applicant against this decision was rejected by the Government (the Ministry of Environment and Energy) on 21 June 1989.\n\nThe applicant, seeking the annulment of the Government\u2019s decision of 21 June 1989, applied to the Supreme Administrative Court (regeringsr\u00e4tten) for review under the 1988 Act on Judicial Review of Certain Administrative Decisions (lagen om r\u00e4ttspr\u00f6vning av vissa f\u00f6rvaltningsbeslut 1988:205 - \u201cthe 1988 Act\u201c). He alleged that, by denying him a special extraction permit, the competent authorities had prevented him from taking measures to comply with the restoration plan; the refusal contravened the principle of objectivity enshrined in Chapter 1, section 9, of the Instrument of Government (regeringsformen, which forms part of the Constitution). Moreover, contrary to the principle of proportionality and section 3 of the 1964 Nature Conservation Act (naturv\u00e5rdslagen 1964:822), the authorities had gone beyond what was necessary in the interests of nature conservation, as well as other public and private interests. Their decision was also incompatible with the aim of nature conservation laid down in section 1(3) of the Act. Finally, the only reply given by the County Administrative Board to his question as to what steps he should take had been that the time-limit for restoration of the pit had expired; he had thus been the victim of a denial of justice. In addition, the applicant asked the Supreme Administrative Court to hold an oral hearing in his case.\n\nIn a decision (beslut) of 13 December 1990, the Supreme Administrative Court, sitting with five judges, dismissed the latter request by three votes to two, finding that there were no grounds under section 9 of the Administrative Procedure Act 1971 (f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen 1971:291; see paragraph 14 below) for holding a hearing. As to the merits, on the basis of written observations submitted by the applicant and the County Administrative Board, it concluded unanimously that the Government\u2019s decision was not unlawful and confirmed it. According to the minutes of deliberations on 30 October 1990, the two judges who were in favour of a hearing had regard in particular to the fact that the 1988 Act had been enacted in order to ensure that Swedish law complied with the Convention standards and also with the Strasbourg Court\u2019s case-law in this area (see paragraph 11 below). They noted moreover that certain essential points of Mr Fredin\u2019s case remained unclear, since there was disagreement between him and the County Administrative Board as to whether the above-mentioned restoration plan (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above) required the further extraction of gravel from the pit or simply the moving of gravel within it. In addition they drew attention to the lack of clarity in Mr Fredin\u2019s plea against the Government. The same two judges considered that the Government, like the applicant and the County Administrative Board, should have submitted written observations on the case; apart from their reasons for rejecting the applicant\u2019s appeal, they should have given their views on the above-mentioned issue of the need for further extraction of gravel and on whether their decision meant that Mr Fredin had been prevented from restoring the pit in the prescribed manner after 1 December 1988.\n\nIt was not possible under Swedish law for the applicant to appeal from the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s decision of 13 December 1990.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in three applications (nos. 45825/99, 45826/99 and 45827/99) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by three United Kingdom nationals, Mr Darin Miller, Mr Michael Morrison and Mr Kevin Gillespie (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 11 January 1999.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr G. Blades, a lawyer practising in Lincoln. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agents, Mr C. Whomersley and, subsequently, Mr J. Grainger, both of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nOn 26 September 2000 the Court decided to join and communicate the applications to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nMr Miller was born in 1972 and he resides in Stockton-on-Tees, Mr Morrison was born in 1970 and he resides in Aberdeen and Mr Gillespie was born in 1974 and he resides in Greenock. They are represented before the Court by Mr Blades, a lawyer practising in Lincoln.\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. The first and second applicants\n\nIn April 1996 the first applicant was a soldier and the second applicant was a non-commissioned officer in the regular forces of the British Army. On 29 April 1996 they were charged along with two others (pursuant to section 70 of the Army Act 1955) with four counts of indecent assault contrary to section 15(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956.\n\nThe convening officer, by order dated 26 July 1996, convened a general court-martial to try them. On 10 September 1996 the first applicant was found guilty on two of the charges and was sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment and to be dismissed with disgrace. The second applicant was found guilty on three of the charges and sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment, to be dismissed from the service with disgrace and to be reduced to the ranks. On 19 December 1996 the confirming officer reduced the first applicant's sentence to two years' imprisonment and the second applicant's sentence to three years and six months' imprisonment, but otherwise the findings of the court-martial were confirmed.\n\nThe applicants petitioned the Defence Council against conviction and sentence. By letters dated 18 February 1998 and 27 February 1997, their representatives were informed of the decisions (taken by the Army Board) to reject their petitions.\n\nBoth applicants applied to the single judge of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court (\u201cCMAC\u201d) for leave to appeal to that court against conviction and sentence. The first applicant pointed to various alleged failings by the judge advocate during the court-martial and argued that his sentence was excessive. The single judge granted leave to appeal to the full CMAC. Before the full CMAC, the first applicant added a new ground of appeal (that he did not have a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, citing Findlay v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I). The second applicant argued before the single judge that the judge advocate had erred and misdirected the court and that he had been denied a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal (referring also to the Findlay judgment). The single judge granted leave to appeal to the full CMAC.\n\nB. The third applicant\n\nOn 4 March 1996 the applicant, a soldier of the regular forces of the British Army, was charged (pursuant to section 70 of the Army Act 1955) with wounding with intent contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and with inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to section 20 of that Act.\n\nThe convening officer, by order dated 13 August 1996, convened a general court-martial. On 6 September 1996 the applicant was found guilty on the first charge and of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to section 47 of the 1861 Act. He was sentenced to three years and six months' imprisonment and to be discharged from the army.\n\nHis petition against sentence to the confirming officer was rejected and his conviction and sentence were promulgated on 10 October 1996. By letter dated 20 November 1996, his legal representatives were informed that his petition against sentence had been rejected by a Reviewing Authority appointed by the Army Board of the Defence Council. By letter dated 24 March 1997, the applicant's representatives were informed of the decision (taken by the Army Board) to reject his petition against sentence.\n\nOn 20 May 1997 he presented a further petition to the Army Board of the Defence Council against conviction arguing that he had not had a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law in accordance with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (referring also to the above-cited Findlay judgment). By letter dated 22 May 1997, he was informed that the Reviewing Authority had decided not to waive the relevant time-limit which had by then expired. It was also indicated in that letter that the \u201cFindlay issue\u201d had been frequently rejected by the Army Board and by the CMAC.\n\nHis application to the single judge of the CMAC was dated 18 July 1997 and raised the Findlay issue together with the fact that he could not appeal against sentence only to the CMAC. On 6 October 1997 the single judge rejected that application considering that the grounds of appeal were not arguable. He renewed his application for leave to appeal to the full CMAC raising the same points.\n\nC. The Courts-Martial Appeal Court (all three applicants)\n\nIn response to these appeals, affidavits were filed on behalf of the Ministry of Defence explaining that neither the presidents nor the members of the applicants' courts-martial had been under the command of the convening officer and that none had been subordinate to him in the chain of command. Accordingly, the convening officer would not have reported on either the president or the members of the court-martial in their annual confidential reports. A policy decision had been taken that, as from 1 January 1996, all courts-martial would be composed of a president and members who were not in the chain of command of the convening officer.\n\nThe applicants' appeals were rejected by detailed judgment of 13 November 1998. As to the \u201cFindlay point\u201d, the CMAC noted the change in policy as regards the constitution of courts-martial in place since January 1996. It considered that there was no chain of command influence and no obvious reason why any observer knowing the constitution of the courts-martial and the full facts would suspect any lack of independence or impartiality. In any event, the CMAC pointed out that the applicants' reliance on the Findlay judgment was misconceived as the only power of the CMAC was to enquire as to whether the convictions were unsafe. Where there was abundant evidence to support the conclusion of the courts-martial which had been properly convened in accordance with domestic law, the composition and behaviour of which had not been criticised, the CMAC considered that there was no possible reason to intervene. It noted that the time for having regard to the provisions of the Convention had not yet been reached, but it was difficult to see, even in such circumstances, how the provisions of Article 6 could be of any assistance to the applicants.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 74025/01) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a United Kingdom national, Mr John Hirst (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 5 July 2001.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr E. Abrahamson, a solicitor practising in Liverpool. The United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Grainger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant complained that as a convicted prisoner he was subject to a blanket ban on voting in elections. He invoked Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 alone and in conjunction with Article 14, as well as Article 10 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 8 July 2003, the Court declared the application partly admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nA hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 16 December 2003 (Rule 59 \u00a7 3). There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Mr J. Grainger, Agent, Ms N. Pittam, Mr M. Rawlings, Ms E. Willmott, Advisers; (b) for the applicant Ms F. Krause, Counsel, Mr E. Abrahamson, Solicitor. The Court heard addresses by Mr Grainger and Ms Krause.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1950 and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in HM Prison Rye Hill, Warwickshire.\n\nOn 11 February 1980, the applicant pleaded guilty to manslaughter on ground of diminished responsibility. His plea of guilty was accepted on the basis of medical evidence that the applicant was a man with a gross personality disorder to such a degree that he was amoral. He was sentenced to a term of discretionary life imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s tariff (that part of the sentence relating to retribution and deterrence) expired on 25 June 1994. His continued detention is based on considerations relating to risk and dangerousness, the Parole Board considering that he continues to present a risk of serious harm to the public.\n\nThe applicant, who is barred by section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 from voting in parliamentary or local elections, issued proceedings in the High Court under section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998, seeking a declaration that this provision was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s application was heard before the Divisional Court on 21 and 22 March 2001, together with the application for judicial review of two other prisoners, Mr Pearson and Mr Feal-Martinez, who had applied for registration as electors and been refused by the Registration Officer and who also sought a declaration of incompatibility.\n\nIn its judgment dated 4 April 2001, the Divisional Court noted that in Europe only eight countries, including the United Kingdom, did not give convicted prisoners a vote, while 20 did not disenfranchise prisoners and eight imposed a more restricted disenfranchisement. Reference was made to the United States Supreme Court which had rejected a challenge to the Californian Constitution\u2019s disenfranchisement of convicted prisoners (Richardson v. Ramirez [1974] 418 US 24); and to Canadian precedents, in particular the Canadian Supreme Court which in the case of Sauv\u00e9 v. Canada (No. 1) ([1992] 2 SCR 438) struck down the disenfranchisement of prisoners as too widely drawn and infringing against the minimum impairment rule and the Federal Court of Appeal which upheld in Sauv\u00e9 (No. 2) ([2000] 2 CF) the subsequent legislative provision which restricted the ban to prisoners serving a sentence of two years or more in a correctional institution. The cases before the European Commission of Human Rights and this Court were also reviewed. Lord Justice Kennedy concluded: \u201c... I return to what was said by the European Court in paragraph 52 of its judgment in Mathieu-Mohin. Of course as far as an individual prisoner is concerned disenfranchisement does impair the very essence of his right to vote, but that is too simplistic an approach, because what Article 3 of the First Protocol is really concerned with is the wider question of universal franchise, and \u2018the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\u2019. If an individual is to be disenfranchised that must be in the pursuit of a legitimate aim. In the case of a convicted prisoner serving his sentence the aim may not be easy to articulate. Clearly there is an element of punishment, and also an element of electoral law. As the Home Secretary said, Parliament has taken the view that for the period during which they are in custody convicted prisoners have forfeited their right to have a say in the way the country is governed. The Working Group said that such prisoners had lost the moral authority to vote. Perhaps the best course is that suggested by Linden JA, namely to leave to philosophers the true nature of this disenfranchisement whilst recognising that the legislation does different things. The European Court also requires that the means employed to restrict the implied Convention rights to vote are not disproportionate, and that is the point at which, as it seems to me, it is appropriate for this court to defer to the legislature. It is easy to be critical of a law which operates against a wide spectrum (e.g. in relation to its effect on post-tariff discretionary life prisoners, and those detained under some provision of the Mental Health Act 1983), but, as is clear from the authorities, those states which disenfranchise following conviction do not all limit the period of disenfranchisement to the period in custody. Parliament in this country could have provided differently in order to meet the objectives which it discerned, and like McLachlin J in Canada, I would accept that the tailoring process seldom admits of perfection, so the courts must afford some leeway to the legislator. As [counsel for the Secretary of State] submits, there is a broad spectrum of approaches among democratic societies, and the United Kingdom falls into the middle of the spectrum. In course of time this position may move, either by way of further fine tuning, as was recently done in relation to remand prisoners and others, or more radically, but its position in the spectrum is plainly a matter for Parliament not for the courts. That applies even to the \u2018hard cases\u2019 of post-tariff discretionary life sentence prisoners... They have all been convicted and if, for example, Parliament were to have said that all those sentenced to life imprisonment lose the franchise for life the apparent anomaly of their position would disappear. ... If section 3 (1) of the 1983 Act can meet the challenge of Article 3 [of the First Protocol] then Article 14 had nothing to offer, any more than Article 10.\u201d\n\nThe applicant\u2019s claims were accordingly rejected as were those of the other prisoners.\n\nOn 2 May 2001, an application for permission to appeal was filed on behalf of Pearson and Feal-Martinez, together with a 43-page skeleton argument. On 15 May 2001, Lord Justice Buxton considered the application on the papers and refused permission on the grounds that the appeal had no real prospect of success.\n\nOn 19 May 2001, the applicant filed an application for permission to appeal. On 7 June 2001, his application was considered on the papers by Lord Justice Simon Brown who refused permission for the same reasons as Lord Justice Buxton in relation to the earlier applications. The applicant\u2019s renewed application, together with the renewed applications of Pearson and Feal-Martinez, were refused on 18 June 2001, after oral argument, by Lord Justice Simon Brown.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) on 28 May 1996, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 20022/92) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by a Swedish citizen, Mrs Anne-Marie Andersson, on 11 February 1992. The Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby Sweden recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 6 \u00a7 1 and 13 of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 35 \u00a7 3 (d) of Rules of Court B, the applicant designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 31).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mrs E. Palm, the elected judge of Swedish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 \u00a7 4 (b)). On 10 June 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr B. Walsh, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr J. De Meyer, Mr A.N. Loizou, Sir John Freeland, Mr A.B. Baka and Mr J. Casadevall (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 \u00a7 5). Subsequently Mr K. Jungwiert, the first substitute judge, replaced Mr Macdonald, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 \u00a7 1 and 24 \u00a7 1).\n\nOn 22 July 1996, the Agent of the Swedish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) wrote to the Registrar to inform him that it was the opinion of the Government that the present case and the case of M.S. v. Sweden (no. 74/1996/693/885) should be considered by the same Chamber and that both cases should be considered by a Grand Chamber in accordance with Rule 53 \u00a7 1. On 13 August 1996 the Registrar informed the Agent that, before drawing lots in the two cases, Mr Ryssdal had considered whether to constitute a single Chamber. However, bearing in mind, inter alia, that none of those taking part in the proceedings had asked that the case be examined by the same Chamber, he decided to constitute a separate Chamber for each case. On 25 August 1996 the Chamber decided not to relinquish jurisdiction in favour of a Grand Chamber.\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 \u00a7 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant's lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 \u00a7 1 and 40). Pursuant to the order made in consequence on 25 August 1996, the Registrar received the applicant's and the Government's memorials on 13 and 16 December 1996 respectively.\n\nThe applicant died on 20 November 1996. On 15 January 1997 her lawyer informed the Registrar that the applicant's son, Mr Stive Andersson, wished to continue with the case. By letters of 28 January and 10 February 1997, the Government objected to his being allowed to do so.\n\nIn accordance with the President's decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 18 March 1997. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court: (a) for the Government Ms E. Jagander, Director, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Agent, Mr G. Sch\u00e4der, Director-General of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Mr B. Reuterstrand, Director-General of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, Ms H. J\u00e4derblom, Legal Adviser, Ministry of Justice, Advisers; (b) for the Commission Mrs G.H. Thune, Delegate; (c) for the applicant Mrs S. Westerberg, Lawyer, Counsel, Mrs C. Bokelund, Lawyer, Mr M. Eliasson, Lawyer, Mrs R. Harrold-Claesson, Lawyer, Advisers, Mrs B. Hellwig, Assistant. The Court heard addresses by Mrs Thune, Mrs Westerberg and Ms Jagander.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. circumstances of the case\n\nThe applicant, Mrs Anne-Marie Andersson was a Swedish citizen. She was born in 1943 and died in 1996 (see paragraph 6 above). She lived in G\u00f6teborg, where she worked as a taxi driver.\n\nAt the time of the events in question, Mrs Andersson was divorced and living with her youngest son, who was born in 1981. From May 1988 onwards, Mrs Andersson was unable to work as a result both of dental problems which caused her severe pain and anxiety about a dispute with her landlord.\n\nIn April 1989 she contacted a psychiatric clinic in G\u00f6teborg in order to receive a medical certificate which would enable her to claim sickness benefit from the Health Insurance Office. From 20 August 1991 the applicant was treated by the chief psychiatrist who drew her attention to the possible detrimental effect her situation might have on her son and advised her to seek support for him from the children's psychiatric clinic or the social authorities. Mrs Andersson, however, considered that her son was a normal child who was not in need of any particular help.\n\nIn January 1992 the psychiatrist informed Mrs Andersson that since the child's health might be at risk, she (the psychiatrist) had an obligation under Swedish law to contact the social authorities (see paragraphs 16\u201317 below). Accordingly, she telephoned a social-welfare officer at the Social Council (socialn\u00e4mnden) and informed her of the applicant's health problems. At the request of that officer the psychiatrist submitted the following written statement on 16 January 1992: \u201cAnne-Marie Andersson has had a polyclinical contact with a psychiatrist at [the clinic] since 19 April 1989, from 20 August 1991 with the undersigned. The reason has been a pain condition in connection with dental problems and this has caused her being on sick-leave as from May 1988. The patient does not consider herself to be mentally ill but she has accepted the contact with us solely due to her need to be put on the sick-list. In my opinion she has an extreme personality and her thoughts are, in conversations here, occupied by her severe pain condition and her dissatisfaction with the treatment she has received. She has once in a while had her son with her. He seemed quiet and sensitive. The undersigned, as well as others in the medical service with whom the patient has been in contact, have worried about the possible effect of her severe pain condition on the son whom she cares for alone. I have on several occasions drawn her attention to this, inter alia in letters (please see copy), and asked her to contact [the children's psychiatric clinic] or the social authorities. As, apparently, this has not been done, I called you today and I now send a written account of the case as agreed. As I do not find that, from a psychiatric point of view, we can do more for the patient, who does not consider herself to be mentally ill, I have referred her to the district medical officer and she will, thus, have no further contact with me.\u201d\n\nBy letter the same day, the psychiatrist notified the applicant of the information imparted to the Council. The relevant part of the letter read as follows: \u201cAs you know, I have several times asked you to seek support for your son who, naturally, cannot remain unaffected by your severe pains. As I have not been able to convince you that this is necessary, I have called [a] social-welfare officer and expressed my concern. Unfortunately, I find myself obliged under the law to take this action in an attempt to reduce future problems for the boy (and thereby also for you).\u201d\n\nThe psychiatrist's concern for the applicant's son was shared by the headmaster and a teacher at the school he attended. In October 1991 they had contacted the Social Council and expressed concern about his learning difficulties and his general state of health. Following this, the Council commenced an investigation which, with Mrs Andersson's agreement, led to the placement of her son in a non-residential therapeutic school on 2 March 1992.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 24265/94) against the United Kingdom lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by an Irish citizen, Mr Liam Devenney (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 12 April 1994.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by P. J. McGrory and Company, a firm of solicitors practising in Belfast. The Government of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley.\n\nThe applicant invoked Articles 6, 13 and 14 of the Convention. He alleged that the issue of a certificate emanating from the Secretary of State, under section 42 of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976, which was deemed conclusive evidence that the applicant\u2019s employment was terminated for the purpose of protecting public safety and public order, operated under the terms of the 1976 Act to deny him access to a court or tribunal, in violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1. He also claimed that he had no effective remedy before a national authority in breach of Article 13, and that he has been discriminated against contrary to Article 14 in conjunction with Article 6.\n\nThe application was declared admissible by the Commission on 24 February 1997 and transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1999 in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 3, second sentence, of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, the Commission not having completed its examination of the case by that date.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court. Sir Nicolas Bratza, the judge elected in respect of the United Kingdom, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr M.P. Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4, the judge elected in respect of Finland, to sit in his place (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nIn the light of the similarities between the present application and the Court\u2019s judgment of 10 July 1998 in the case of Tinnelly and Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV, p. 1643), neither the Government nor the applicant filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). Submissions were made concerning just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nOn 18 August 1992, the applicant began work in the Culloden Hotel, Belfast, as a silver service waiter. This hotel is owned by Moyola Cellars Limited, which is subsidiary of Hastings Hotels Group Limited. Initially the applicant had been doing very well and was optimistic about promotion. On 31 October 1992, the restaurant manager informed the applicant that he was being dismissed forthwith. The applicant was given no reason whatsoever for his peremptory dismissal. Various attempts to get an explanation for the dismissal were unsuccessful. Ultimately the general manager told the applicant on 1 November 1992 that he was dismissed because he did not meet the grade and there was no other reason. Of all the full-time and permanent staff in the restaurant the applicant believes that he was the only Catholic.\n\nThe applicant made a complaint to the Fair Employment Tribunal that he had been unlawfully discriminated against on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion. The applicant and thirteen of his fifteen siblings are not involved in any politically related activity.\n\nBy a letter of 22 December 1992, the applicant\u2019s solicitors wrote to the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (\u201cRUC\u201d) stating that they had been informed that the reason for the applicant\u2019s dismissal from his employment at the Culloden Hotel was an approach made to the Hotel by members of the RUC who had stated that the applicant was a suspect. The solicitors requested that the RUC provide information as to what the applicant was suspected of and on what basis the applicant had been allegedly described as a suspect. The RUC replied to this letter, stating that they were unable to comment on such matters, it not being force policy to do so.\n\nOn 29 March 1993 the solicitors acting on behalf of the applicant\u2019s employers wrote to the Fair Employment Tribunal. \u201cWe return herewith Notice of Appearance in relation to the application presented by Mr Liam Devenney. On our instructions, the acts of which complaint is made, were done for the purpose of protecting public safety, and in the circumstances by virtue of Section 42 of the Fair Employment Act 1976, the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts do not apply so that the tribunal does not have jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.\u201d\n\nThe Fair Employment Tribunal then of its own motion fixed a preliminary hearing for determination of the following issue: \u201cWhether the tribunal has jurisdiction to consider the applicant\u2019s complaint in view of the provisions of Section 42 of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976.\u201d\n\nOn 3 December 1993 the Fair Employment Commission, acting on behalf of the applicant, wrote to the solicitors acting on behalf of the applicant\u2019s employers requesting to know, inter alia, whether the Secretary of State or any other Agency had been approached with a view to obtaining a Section 42 (2) certificate. By reply of 6 December 1993 the employers\u2019 solicitors stated: \u201cWe today received your letter dated 3 December 1993 in relation to the above. You will be pleased to hear that during the writer\u2019s holiday last week a Section 42 certificate was received from the Crown Solicitor\u2019s office (a certified copy of which is enclosed herewith) so that it now seems unnecessary to take any further action, and that you may close your file in this matter.\u201d\n\nThe applicant stated that he did not know the basis upon which the certificate was issued. He had never been shown, and was not entitled to demand, sight of the information, if any, which was placed before the Secretary of State which led to the certificate being issued. The applicant did not know whether this information was correct or incorrect, whether it was complete or incomplete, and whether it was reliable or not. Nor did he know whether the information provided could reasonably support the view expressed in the certificate.\n\nThe matter first came before the Fair Employment Tribunal on 3 June 1994. On that occasion the Tribunal declared that the certificate presented did not affect the applicability of the Fair Employment Acts to the dismissal of the applicant by Moyola Cellars Limited, since the certificate referred to an act done by the Hastings Hotel Group.\n\nAt a resumed hearing on 5 January 1995 the Fair Employment Tribunal were presented with a new certificate signed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and certifying that the decision by Moyola Cellars Limited to terminate its contract of employment with the applicant was for the purpose of protecting public safety and public order. In light of the certificate, the Fair Employment Tribunal found that the Fair Employment Act did not apply to the termination of the applicant\u2019s contract, nor to the decision summarily to terminate the contract and accordingly that: \u201cthere is nothing for this Tribunal to consider in relation to that act [of termination].\u201d The tribunal dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaints in relation to his dismissal and the manner of his dismissal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 36689/02) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Swedish national, Mr Lasse Lilja (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 20 September 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Ms E.-L. Kiiski, a lawyer practising in Sundbyberg. The Swedish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr M. Falk, Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nOn 6 September 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Norsborg.\n\nA. Criminal proceedings\n\nOn 21 October 1996 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of aggravated tax fraud and an aggravated bookkeeping offence in relation to the declaration of value-added tax and employers\u2019 contributions for the period July 1994 \u2013 September 1996 by Latem AB, a building company wholly owned by him. He was detained by a decision of the District Court (tingsr\u00e4tten) of Stockholm on 23 October 1996 and released from detention on 3 December 1996.\n\nThe applicant was interrogated on several occasions in 1996 and 1997. The preliminary investigation, which concerned 20 companies, was concluded on 25 April 1998. The applicant was notified of the investigation report which covered 7,000 pages. Following submissions by the various suspects, the public prosecutor declared in June 1999 that he expected to bring indictments in the autumn of 1999.\n\nOn 51 occasions thereafter, the public prosecutor requested and the District Court granted extensions of the time-limit for bringing indictments. Eventually, on 28 October 2002 the applicant, together with 16 other suspects, was indicted for aggravated tax fraud and an aggravated bookkeeping offence. The trial commenced on 2 September 2003.\n\nBy a partial judgment of 4 December 2003, the District Court acquitted the applicant of certain charges. By a further judgment of 27 February 2004 the District Court acquitted him of the remaining charges. In the absence of an appeal from the prosecutor, the latter judgment acquired legal force on 19 March 2004.\n\nB. Tax proceedings\n\nOn 22 October 1996 the Tax Authority (skattemyndigheten) of the County of Stockholm initiated an audit of Latem AB\u2019s liability for value-added tax and employers\u2019 contributions concerning the above-mentioned period. On 24 June 1997 the County Administrative Court (l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten) of the County of Stockholm, at the request of the Tax Authority, issued an order that assets belonging to the company could be claimed in security for unpaid value-added tax (but not for any tax surcharges that might be imposed on the company). On 5 December 1997 the Tax Authority completed its audit report. By its communication to the company the same day, the company was informed that the Tax Authority was considering, inter alia, imposing tax surcharges on it.\n\nOn the basis of the findings of the audit, the Tax Authority, by decisions of 18 December 1997 and 26 March and 1 April 1998, revised upwards the taxation bases for calculating the relevant taxes by a total of approximately 3 million Swedish kronor (SEK) (value-added tax) and approximately SEK 14.6 million (employers\u2019 contributions). In addition, Latem AB was considered responsible for employees\u2019 taxes based on a total salary amount of approximately SEK 10.6 million. Moreover, as the information supplied by the company in its tax returns was found to be incorrect, the Tax Authority ordered it to pay tax surcharges (skattetill\u00e4gg, avgiftstill\u00e4gg) amounting to 20% of the increased tax liability for value-added tax and employers\u2019 contributions.\n\nThe company appealed to the County Administrative Court. Following an oral hearing on 11 November 1999, the court, by six judgments of 29 November 1999, upheld the Tax Authority\u2019s decisions, save for a minor reduction of the taxation base for employers\u2019 contributions for one year.\n\nOn 4 February 2000 the company appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarr\u00e4tten) in Stockholm. On 12 February 2003, the appellate court held an oral hearing and, by a judgment of 10 March 2003, it upheld the County Administrative Court\u2019s judgments.\n\nOn 2 October 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court (Regerings-r\u00e4tten) refused leave to appeal.\n\nC. Other proceedings\n\nOn 15 February 2002 the applicant complained to the Parliamentary Ombudsman (Justitieombudsmannen) about the preliminary investigation against him. The matter was referred to the Director General of the National Economic Crimes Bureau.\n\nIn a decision of 22 November 2002, the Director General criticised the responsible prosecutor for the delays in the preliminary investigation. He found that the prosecutor should have decided whether to bring an indictment at the latest during the autumn of 1999 and thus disagreed with the prosecutor\u2019s opinion that he had to await the outcome of the tax proceedings. The Director General further stated that, whatever reasons there might have been for the delay, it was unacceptable for a suspect to have to wait more than four years after a completed preliminary investigation for a decision whether he would be indicted for offences dating back even further. The Director General was also astonished that the District Court had repeatedly extended the time-limit set for bringing an indictment. Noting that the prosecutor had not given any information on the state of the investigation when requesting extensions and that the court had not asked for such information, he pointed out that the court\u2019s task when examining such requests was to determine whether the seizure of property should remain, to keep itself informed of the state of the investigation and to see to it that the investigation proceeded with appropriate speed.\n\nThe applicant further requested compensation for suffering caused by his detention in 1996. On 2 June 2004 the Chancellor of Justice, pursuant to the Act on Compensation for Deprivations of Liberty (Lagen om ers\u00e4ttning vid frihetsinskr\u00e4nkning, 1974:515), awarded him SEK 35,000 for suffering and SEK 2,500 for legal costs.\n\nUpon application by the Enforcement Office (kronofogde-myndigheten) representing the State, the District Court, on 18 December 2003, declared Latem AB bankrupt on the basis of unpaid taxes and surcharges totalling approximately SEK 10.7 million which were due as a consequence of the above tax decisions.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 28394/95) against the Kingdom of Sweden lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Swedish national, Marta D\u00f6ry (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 21 May 1995.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was until 23 June 2000 represented by Mr G. Antal and thereafter by Mr U. Jacobson, both lawyers practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Jagander, Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe applicant alleged that her rights under Article 6 of the Convention had been violated on account of the lack of an oral hearing in judicial proceedings concerning social security benefits.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 23 May 2000 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. Case concerning industrial injury benefits as from 28 April 1990\n\nBy a provisional decision of 25 April 1990 the Social Insurance Office (f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan; hereinafter \u201cthe Office\u201d) of the County of Stockholm decided that payments of industrial injury benefits to the applicant, who was born in 1954, should be discontinued as from 1 March 1990. This decision was confirmed by a final decision of 2 July 1990. The Office considered that the applicant\u2019s ability to work was not reduced due to her back problems to such an extent that she was entitled to the benefits in question under the applicable rules of the Act on Industrial Injury Insurance (Lagen om arbetsskadef\u00f6rs\u00e4kring, 1976:380; hereinafter \u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d)\n\nThe applicant later requested the Office to review its decision, which it did on 20 November 1991. Save for the grant of benefits for the period 1 March \u2013 27 April 1990, the Office upheld its previous decision and also found that the applicant was not entitled to a life annuity.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court (l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten) of the County of Stockholm, claiming that she was entitled to continued benefits after 27 April 1990. She maintained that the medical evidence, on which the Office\u2019s decision was based, in fact showed that she was entitled to the benefits sought.\n\nBy a judgment of 8 April 1992 the County Administrative Court upheld the Office\u2019s decision. The court\u2019s assessment was based on medical certificates from three different physicians who all stated that the applicant was able to work and thus was not entitled to the benefits in question. It did not hold an oral hearing, nor did the applicant request one.\n\nThe applicant then appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarr\u00e4tten) in Stockholm. In support of her appeal she invoked medical certificates issued by three other physicians. Furthermore, without stating any reasons for her request, she asked the court to hold an oral hearing.\n\nOn 5 November 1992 the appellate court rejected the request for an oral hearing. After having restated section 9 of the Administrative Court Procedure Act (F\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen, 1971:291; hereinafter \u201cthe 1971 Act\u201d; see further paragraph 28 below), it gave the following reasons: \u201cHaving regard to the subject-matter at issue and the information that has so far come to hand in the case, [the court] finds that an oral hearing is at present unnecessary. [The applicant] is invited to submit her final written observations in the case within two weeks after having been notified of this decision. The case can be determined notwithstanding a failure to submit such written observations.\u201d\n\nOn 25 February 1994 the Administrative Court of Appeal, relying on the medical evidence submitted in the case, rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal. It also rejected her renewed request for an oral hearing.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the judgment to the Supreme Social Insurance Court (F\u00f6rs\u00e4krings\u00f6verdomstolen). She complained about the lack of oral hearings in the lower courts. In that respect, she maintained that the case had not been adequately investigated and that an oral hearing had been necessary for her to explain matters of importance to the courts\u2019 assessment.\n\nBy a letter of 9 February 1995 the Supreme Social Insurance Court informed the applicant that an oral hearing in the case appeared to be unnecessary. She was given the opportunity to submit further observations on the question of leave to appeal.\n\nOn 8 June 1995 the Supreme Social Insurance Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.\n\nB. Case concerning sickness benefits as from 1 July 1991\n\nThe applicant was on sick-leave between 1 May and 30 June 1991, during which period she received per diem sickness benefits under the Social Insurance Act (Lagen om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring, 1962:381; hereinafter \u201cthe 1962 Act\u201d). However, by a decision of 7 August 1991 the Office found that she was no longer entitled to such benefits. At the applicant\u2019s request, the Office reviewed its decision on 10 June 1992 but did not change it.\n\nOn 15 September 1993 the County Administrative Court, upon the applicant\u2019s appeal, found that the available medical evidence did not show that she was entitled to benefits as from 1 July 1991. The appeal was thus rejected. It does not appear that the applicant asked for an oral hearing before this instance.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal. She requested also in this case that the appellate court hold an oral hearing and, moreover, asked it to obtain further medical evidence. On 2 December 1993 the court rejected the requests, giving the same reasons on the issue of an oral hearing as in its decision of 5 November 1992 (see paragraph 13 above).\n\nOn 25 February 1994 the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal and her renewed request for an oral hearing.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the judgment to the Supreme Social Insurance Court. She requested again that an oral hearing be held in the case. She also complained about the lack of oral hearings in the lower courts.\n\nBy a letter of 9 February 1995 the Supreme Social Insurance Court informed the applicant that an oral hearing in the case appeared to be unnecessary. She was given the opportunity to submit further observations on the question of leave to appeal.\n\nOn 8 June 1995 the Supreme Social Insurance Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 30034/04) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Ashiq Hussain Elahi (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 22 July 2004.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr B. Hussain, a lawyer practising in Birmingham. The British Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Derek Walton, Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nOn 12 July 2005, the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.\n\nThe applicant was born in 1967 and, at the time of lodging his application with the Court, was serving a sentence of imprisonment in HM Prison Ranby, Nottinghamshire.\n\nIn October 1995, in response to an increase in the availability of heroin in Bradford, the police commenced \u201cOperation Trafalgar\u201d, to identify and target those responsible. On the basis of intelligence reports the police reached the conclusion that the applicant was the head of a group of Asian drug traffickers operating in the area. Video recordings made of his house and his itemised telephone bill indicated that he was in regular contact with suspected drug dealers from elsewhere in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn 17 July 1996, in accordance with Home Office Guidelines (\u201cthe Guidelines\u201d: see paragraphs 16-18 of the Khan judgment, cited in paragraph 12 below) the Chief Constable authorised the use of a covert listening device in the applicant\u2019s house. On 19 July 1996 the applicant was arrested for suspected car theft and a warrant was obtained to search his house for documents relating to motor vehicles. When executing the warrant the police covertly installed listening and recording equipment inside his house. Recordings were made between 19 July and 21 November 1996. The Chief Constable\u2019s authorisation had been obtained for the entire period, except 16 August and 6 September, when the authorisation had lapsed and not been renewed, due to an oversight.\n\nIt was the prosecution\u2019s case at the subsequent trial that the recordings obtained in this way revealed detailed discussions between the applicant and his co-accused demonstrating their involvement in conspiracies to import and distribute Class A drugs, in particular heroin.\n\nThe applicant was arrested, together with a number of alleged associates, and charged with conspiracy to import and supply Class A drugs. He and his co-accused applied to have the prosecution struck out for abuse of process and/or the recordings excluded from evidence. On 14 January 1999 the trial judge ruled against the defendants, observing as follows: \u201cI respectfully note the conclusion of the European Commission of Human rights in the case of Michael Govell v. the United Kingdom, adopted 14 January 1998, to the effect that the use of covert listening devices in accordance with the Guidelines is not done in accordance with the law and is thus in breach of Article 8, because in the United Kingdom there is as yet no legally binding publicly accessible body of law regulating such activity. I bear in mind that the Convention is not yet part of our law, but that where possible domestic law should be interpreted in accordance with Convention principles. I take into account that in intruding on the privacy of Elahi\u2019s home the police will have committed civil trespass and possibly criminal damage. I take into account that there may have been conduct outside the Home Office Guidelines, in that the authority for the continued use of the listening device may not have been in place between 16 August and 6 September. On the other hand, I bear in mind my finding that the police followed the Guidelines to the letter in all other respects and did not intend deliberately to circumvent the requirement to obtain the Chief Constable\u2019s authority. I take into account that the police acted in good faith throughout in pursuit of the public good in the detection and prosecution of very serious crime. Balancing these factors, I\u2019m satisfied that there is no evidence of abuse of power by the police which could found the basis for a stay of the proceedings as being an abuse of process. ... I turn next to consider the court\u2019s exclusionary power under s. 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. ... Being in tape recorded form there\u2019s unlikely to be dispute about [the evidence\u2019s] authenticity. It is highly relevant and potentially probative of the defendants\u2019 involvement in the conspiracies alleged. It did not result from incitement, entrapment or inducements, or other conduct of that sort. The fact that the defendants may not have said what they did if they\u2019d known the police were listening in does not mean that reception of evidence of what they said is unfair. The potential branches of the civil or criminal law and Article 8 and the possible lack of the Chief Constable\u2019s authority between certain dates do not affect the quality of the evidence ...\u201d\n\nFollowing this ruling, the applicant absconded. He was convicted in his absence on 27 August 1999, and sentenced to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nIt appears that the applicant was arrested some years later, at which point he appealed against conviction, arguing that the covertly obtained recordings should not have been used at trial and that he had made the damaging recorded statements only because he had been entrapped into so doing by participating informants. His renewed application was rejected by the full Court of Appeal on 25 May 2004, on the grounds that the trial judge\u2019s ruling of 14 January 1999 was irreproachable and that there was no evidence of entrapment or any other abusive action on the part of the police.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 8610/02) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Ms \u00d6zden Bilgin (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 12 November 2002.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr E. Kanar and Mrs Y. Ba\u015fara, lawyers practising in \u0130stanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 7 July 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1959 and lives in \u0130stanbul.\n\nOn 17 September 1993 the applicant was arrested together with four other suspects in a shop and taken into custody by police officers at the \u0130stanbul Security Directorate on suspicion of membership of an illegal armed organisation. The police found illegal documents, one Kalashnikov rifle, two automatic guns and five other guns in the premises.\n\nOn 1 October 1993 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor at the \u0130stanbul State Security Court. On the same day, she was also brought before a judge at the \u0130stanbul State Security Court who ordered her remand in custody.\n\nOn 31 December 1993 the public prosecutor at the \u0130stanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant and requested her conviction under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of Law no. 3713. The applicant was accused of taking part in a number of events, i.e. bombings of shops and cars, aggravated theft and causing bodily injury to third persons.\n\nOn 21 March 1994 the \u0130stanbul State Security Court commenced the trial of the applicant together with twenty-three co-accused.\n\nIn the meantime, another trial against the applicant before the \u0130stanbul Martial Law Court was pending.\n\nIn the course of the criminal proceedings, at the end of each hearing, the \u0130stanbul State Security Court considered releasing the applicant pending trial both ex officio as well as upon her requests. At each hearing, the court taking into account the nature of the offence, the state of the evidence and the content of the case-file, decided to prolong the applicant's remand in custody.\n\nMeanwhile, on 17 November 2000, the applicant's lawyer challenged his client's continued detention before the district court. He submitted, inter alia, that his client had been detained for seven years and two months and that there was no danger that she could destroy the evidence, which had all been submitted to the case file, or that she would abscond. The District Court dismissed his request on 20 November 2000 on the same grounds as before, namely \u201chaving regard to the nature of the offence, the state of the evidence and the content of the case file\u201d.\n\nOn 17 December 2003 the \u0130stanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced her to life imprisonment.\n\nThe applicant appealed.\n\nOn 1April 2005 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first instance court.\n\nSubsequent to promulgation of Law no. 5190 on 16 June 2004, which abolished the State Security Courts, the \u0130stanbul Assize Court acquired jurisdiction over the applicant's case. The case is still pending before this court.\n\nOn 19 July 2005 the applicant's lawyer challenged his client's continued detention before the District Court. The latter dismissed the request on 22 July 2005 on similar grounds, namely \u201chaving regard to the nature of the offence, the state of the evidence and the content of the case file\u201d.\n\nOn 21 December 2005 the applicant was released pending trial.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 74321/01) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by three Turkish nationals, Mr Osman Ko\u015fti, Mr Mehmet Ko\u015fti and Mr H\u0131\u015fman \u00d6ng\u00f6r (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 27 May 2001.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr M. Vefa, a lawyer practising in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 25 August 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the length of the applicants' remand in custody and the criminal proceedings brought against them. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1981, 1983 and 1981 respectively and live in \u015eanl\u0131urfa.\n\nThe applicants were arrested and taken into custody on 19 and 20 February 1999 respectively on suspicion of their involvement in the throwing of Molotov cocktails at various public buildings. On 23 February 1999 the Suru\u00e7 Magistrates' Court ordered their remand in custody. The applicants were aged sixteen (Mehmet Ko\u015fti) and eighteen (the other applicants) at the time of the events.\n\nOn 23 March 1999 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicants and four other persons, accusing them of throwing Molotov cocktails at the Suru\u00e7 primary school and the Suru\u00e7 public garage on 18 February 1999 and of attempting to throw Molotov cocktail at the Suru\u00e7 Atat\u00fcrk primary school with a view to supporting the activities of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers' Party). The charges were brought under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Turkish Criminal Code.\n\nOn 7 April 1999 the criminal proceedings against the applicants and four other accused commenced before the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court.\n\nOn 12 May 1999 the court heard the applicants who refuted the allegations against them and their earlier submissions given before the police, public prosecutor and the Magistrates' Court. They also challenged the accuracy of the arrest protocol and the report on the reconstruction of the events. The court decided to secure the testimony of those who had attended the arrest and the reconstruction of events and the submissions of the accused who were not detained. It further ordered that the birth date of H\u0131\u015fman \u00d6ng\u00f6r and another accused be determined since they had claimed that they were actually born in 1986.\n\nBetween 12 May 1999 and 22 December 2000, the Diyarbak\u0131r Security Court held fifteen hearings where it took various procedural decisions and postponed the trial as the procedure concerning the determination of the age of two accused had not been completed.\n\nAt the hearings held on 22 December 2000 and 20 February 2001 respectively, the court requested the prosecution and the defendants to submit their observations on the merits of the case. On 10 April 2001 the applicants' lawyer requested an extension for the submission of the applicants' observations. This request was accepted by the court.\n\nThroughout the proceedings the applicants' lawyer repeatedly requested that the applicants be released pending trial. He maintained, inter alia, that they were juveniles and that their acts could not be considered to constitute an offence under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Court. The first instance court dismissed the applicants' requests until 29 May 2001, having regard to the nature of the offence with which they were charged and the state of the evidence.\n\nOn 29 May 2001 the court decided to defer sentencing the applicants and their co-accused, pursuant to Law no. 4616. It therefore ordered the release of the applicants from detention.\n\nThe public prosecutor appealed.\n\nOn 20 September 2001 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the first instance court.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) on 16 September 1996, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 \u00a7 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 22410/93) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 by two British citizens, Mr Geoffrey Robins and Mrs Margaret Robins, on 14 March 1993. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 \u00a7 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and sought leave to present their own case. However, the President of the Chamber, Mr R. Bernhardt, declined to grant the requested leave and the applicants subsequently designated the lawyer who would represent them (Rule 30 \u00a7 1).\n\nThe Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 \u00a7 4 (b)). On 17 September 1996, in the presence of the Deputy Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr I. Foighel, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr A.B. Baka, Mr L. Wildhaber, Mr D. Gotchev and Mr U. L\u014dhmus (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 \u00a7 5).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 \u00a7 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Deputy Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d), the applicants\u2019 lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 \u00a7 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence and subsequent extensions of the time-limit granted at the request of the applicants\u2019 solicitors, the Registrar received the Government\u2019s memorial on 2 April 1997 and the applicants\u2019 memorial on 11 April 1997.\n\nOn 25 April 1997 the Chamber decided to dispense with a hearing in the case, having satisfied itself that the conditions for this derogation from its usual procedure had been met (Rules 26 and 38).\n\nIn the light of this decision, the Government, applicants and Commission were invited to submit written comments on the matters raised in the memorials. The Registrar subsequently received letters from the Government\u2019s Agent and the applicants\u2019 solicitors on the subject, inter alia, of the applicants\u2019 claims under Article 50 of the Convention.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. Circumstances of the case\n\nA. Background\n\nThe applicants, Mr and Mrs Robins, born respectively in 1942 and 1943, are resident in Crediton, Devon and in London.\n\nThe background to the case is a dispute between neighbours over sewerage. Initially the applicants\u2019 neighbours, Mr and Mrs T., instituted proceedings seeking damages for problems experienced with their sewerage, allegedly caused by work carried out by the applicants. Mr and Mrs T. won their case. On 26 February 1988 the applicants then instituted proceedings against Mr and Mrs T. in the Exeter County Court in Devon, alleging that the latter\u2019s sewage was seeping onto their land. On 1 May 1991, Judge Clarke gave judgment against the applicants. Their appeal was subsequently dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\n\nB. The costs proceedings\n\nIn England and Wales it is usual that the unsuccessful party to litigation pays the costs of the successful party (see paragraph 19 below). On 31 May 1991, Mr and Mrs T., who were not in receipt of legal aid, requested a hearing to determine costs issues. The applicants had been and were legally aided throughout the litigation to appeal stage. Although this did not affect the amount of costs Mr and Mrs T. would be entitled to receive, after having made an order for costs it would be necessary for the judge to assess the applicants\u2019 means for the purposes of section 17 of the Legal Aid Act 1988 (\u201cthe 1988 Act\u201d \u2013 see paragraph 20 below).\n\nAfter hearings on 5 and 6 August 1991, the matter was adjourned until 19 September 1991, to be heard at Torquay County Court, also in Devon. As the question of costs could not be resolved because of factual disputes and conflict between the parties, on 24 September 1991 Judge Clarke made a direction that the inquiry should be adjourned and not restored until a number of points concerning the applicants\u2019 entitlement to legal aid had been clarified. In particular, information was sought as to whether the applicants had advised the Legal Aid Board (\u201cLAB\u201d) of any change in their circumstances and whether revocation of their legal-aid certificate, if necessary, would have any retrospective effect.\n\nOn 25 November 1991, the court received a report from the LAB outlining events from the time the applicants first applied for legal aid. This report was sent to the parties on 14 January 1992, when they were informed that the matter could be re-listed for hearing. However, on 4 February 1992, the LAB informed the court that a fresh Department of Social Security (\u201cDSS\u201d) assessment of the applicants\u2019 means was required in view of the fact that they had separated. The DSS later explained, in a letter filed with the court on 10 November 1992, that a delay of nine months had been caused because of a misapprehension in this respect; in fact, the applicants had not separated.\n\nThe restored hearing was held on 12\u201313 November 1992 before Judge Darwall-Smith, as Judge Clarke had fallen ill. Examining the criteria set out in section 17 (1) of the 1988 Act (see paragraph 20 below), the judge ordered that 4,599 pounds sterling (GBP), which had previously been retained by the LAB following an award of damages to the applicants resulting from a successful negligence action against a firm of solicitors, should be paid to Mr and Mrs T. forthwith and that the applicants should in addition pay them GBP 6,000 in instalments of GBP 100 per month.\n\nC. The appeal against the costs order\n\nThe applicants sought legal aid to appeal against this decision. On 11 January 1993 they applied for an extension of time, since the time-limit for appealing the costs order had expired on 11 December 1992. Subsequently queries were raised by a lawyer in the Civil Appeals Office as to whether leave to appeal was required, and the matter was referred to the registrar.\n\nIn March 1993, September 1993 and March 1994 the applicants contacted the Court of Appeal asking why there was a delay in dealing with their application.\n\nOn 10 April 1994, the registrar directed that leave was not required to appeal against the costs order. With a view to avoiding the time and expense of holding two hearings, one before him for the extension of time and another before the full Court of Appeal, he referred the application to the full court to determine the question of the time extension and, if granted, immediately to hear the appeal.\n\nThe applicants were requested to lodge the relevant documents by 2 May 1994. Extensions of this time-limit were granted on 25 April, 24 May, 16 June, 6 July and again on 27 July 1994 at the request of the applicants, because they were experiencing difficulty in obtaining transcripts and judge\u2019s notes of hearings from the first-instance courts. It later transpired that Judge Clarke\u2019s notes had been either lost or did not exist. On 6 October 1994, the registrar granted the applicants\u2019 request that transcripts of the judgment of Judge Darwall-Smith be produced at public expense.\n\nAnother extension of the time-limit for the submission of documents was granted, upon the applicants\u2019 request, on 16 February 1995. On 6 March 1995 the documents were finally lodged with the Court of Appeal\u2019s Office and on 29 March 1995 the application was listed for hearing. After the hearing on 19 June 1995, the Court of Appeal confirmed Judge Darwall-Smith\u2019s judgment of 13 November 1992 and dismissed the appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 10424/05) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Russian national, Mr Ruslan Kurkaev (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 21 March 2005.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr H. K. Elban, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent. The Russian Government did not exercise their right to intervene (Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 \u00a7 1 (b)).\n\nOn 29 September 2009 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1983 and lives in Istanbul.\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nThe applicant was living in Grozny, Chechnya. Fearing for his life he left for Azerbaijan in August 2000, from where he flew to Istanbul on 4 September 2000.\n\nOn 23 June 2004 the applicant and a number of other individuals were taken into custody by police officers of the Anti-Terrorist Branch of the Istanbul Security Headquarters, within the framework of the security measures implemented for the 2004 NATO summit in Istanbul.\n\nOn 25 June 2004 the applicant was transferred to the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters with a view to deportation. On 29 June 2004 the Istanbul State Security Court issued a decision of non-prosecution, holding that there was no evidence to initiate criminal proceedings against the applicant or other individuals taken into detention in connection with the 2004 NATO summit.\n\nThe applicant then continued to be held in the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters under section 23 of Law no. 5683 as an administrative measure pending deportation proceedings.\n\nOn 25 September 2004 the applicant was released and since then has been living in Istanbul on renewable temporary residence permits.\n\nII. CONDITIONS OF DETENTION\n\nA. The applicant's account\n\nThe applicant alleged that he had been detained for a period of ninety-one days in an overcrowded room at the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters, which had no windows, hence no natural light. According to the applicant it had thirty-six beds for a number of asylum seekers varying from 100 to 200. Due to the large number of asylum seekers present in the establishment the applicant, on numerous occasions, had been forced to sleep on the ground without sheets or blankets. He had not been allowed to get any fresh air or exercise throughout his stay. The hygienic conditions were extremely poor, in particular the showering facilities. There were three toilets and two showers serving a minimum of one hundred asylum seekers. The food served was insufficient and was the same every day. In support of his complaints the applicant presented drawings of the facility and referred to the reports of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), in particular CPT/Inf (2002)8 dated 24 April 2002 and CPT/Inf (2000)17 dated 7 December 2000.\n\nB. The Government's account\n\nThe Government stated that the applicant had been held in the men's section of the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters, which measured 220 square metres. There were three toilets, two showers, twenty bunk beds, a television, two telephones, two air conditioners and a cafeteria. According to the Government all the rooms were sufficiently lit and ventilated. They were cleaned twice a day. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were served every day. Asylum seekers could be visited by their relatives in the visitors' room. Those who needed medical help were taken to the local State hospital and their medical expenses were born by the State.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 39428/98) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr B\u00fcnyamin \u0130nan (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 18 August 1997.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mrs Oya Ersoy Ataman, a lawyer practising in Ankara (Turkey). The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr R\u0131za T\u00fcrmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc to sit as an ad hoc judge, in his place (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nThe President of the Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present application should be joined to other applications against the same respondent State raising the same complaints (applications nos. 26480/95, 28291/95, 29280/95, 26699/96, 29700/96, 29701/96, 29702/96, 29703/96, 29911/96, 29912/96, 29913/96, 31831/96, 31834/96, 31853/96, 31880/96, 31891/96, 31960/96, 32964/96, 32987/96, 32900/96, 33362/96, 33369/96, 33645/96, 34591/96, 34687/96, and 43362/96) (Rule 43 \u00a7 2).\n\nBy a decision of 31 August 1999, having obtained the parties\u2019 observations, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. Arrest and detention of the applicant\n\nOn 1 December 1980 police officers from the Ankara Security Directorate arrested the applicant on suspicion of membership of an illegal armed organisation, the Dev-Yol (Revolutionary Way).\n\nOn 2 March 1981 the Ankara Martial Law Court (s\u0131k\u0131y\u00f6netim mahkemesi) ordered the applicant\u2019s detention on remand.\n\nB. Trial in the Ankara Martial Law Court\n\nOn 26 February 1982 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Martial Law Court against the applicant and 722 other defendants. The Public Prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of the Dev-Yol, whose object was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. The prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code.\n\nOn 14 September 1988 the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nIn a judgment of 19 July 1989 the Martial Law Court convicted the applicant of membership of the Dev-Yol. It sentenced the applicant to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment under Article 146 \u00a7 3 of the Turkish Criminal Code, permanently debarred him from employment in the civil service.\n\nC. Proceedings on appeal\n\nThe applicant appealed.\n\nFollowing promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Court of Cassation (yarg\u0131tay) acquired jurisdiction over the case and on 26 December 1994 the case file was transmitted to it.\n\nOn 27 December 1995 the Court of Cassation quashed the applicant\u2019s conviction on the ground that he should have been convicted of the offence under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code. It referred the case to the Ankara Assize Court (a\u011f\u0131r ceza mahkemesi). The criminal proceedings are still pending before the latter court.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case was referred to the Court on 12 July 1993 by the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201c) and on 3 August 1993 by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (\u201cthe Government\u201c), within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 18949/91) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 25 March 1991 by a British citizen, Mr Peter Maxwell. The Commission\u2019s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government\u2019s application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). The object of the request and the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c).\n\nIn response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant indicated in a letter postmarked 22 July 1993 that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings. On 17 November 1993 he submitted a claim for just satisfaction (Rule 50 para. 1, read together with paragraph (k) of Rule 1).\n\nOn 23 August 1993, the President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice this case and the case of Boner v. the United Kingdom (no. 30/1993/425/504) should be heard by the same Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6). The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 25 August 1993, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr R. Macdonald, Mr J. De Meyer, Mrs E. Palm, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr F. Bigi, Mr A.B. Baka and Mr J. Makarczyk (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\n\nAs President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government\u2019s memorial on 10 January 1994. On 15 April 1994 the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would not submit written observations in reply.\n\nNotwithstanding his stated intention not to participate in the proceedings (see paragraph 2 above), on 23 February 1994 the applicant, having obtained the President\u2019s leave, lodged written observations in reply to the Government\u2019s memorial.\n\nIn accordance with the President\u2019s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 18 April 1994. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\n\nfor the Government Mr I. Christie, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Agent, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, QC, Lord Advocate, Mr R. Reed, Counsel, Mr I. Jamieson, Mr A. Dickson, Advisers;\n\nfor the Commission Mr L. Loucaides, Delegate. The Court heard addresses by Mr Loucaides and Lord Rodger as well as replies to its questions.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, Mr Peter Maxwell, is a British citizen born in 1944. He lives in Perth, Scotland. On 14 or 15 February 1990 two masked men broke into a private house, situated in Stevenston, Scotland. They assaulted the occupant causing him severe injury and permanent disfigurement. On 19 February 1990 Mr Maxwell was arrested together with another man. They were indicted on a charge of assault. They were both held in custody until trial started on 28 May 1990 in the High Court of Justiciary at Kilmarnock, Scotland.\n\nOn 29 May 1990 the jury found the applicant guilty of the charge. Taking account of his bad criminal record, the judge sentenced him to five years\u2019 imprisonment. Legal aid had been made available to the applicant for the preparation of his defence and for his representation by counsel at the trial.\n\nAfter conviction, Mr Maxwell instructed a new firm of solicitors, who then asked counsel who had represented him at the trial to advise on the prospects of an appeal. Having received counsel\u2019s advice, the solicitors informed the applicant that they could not identify any basis for an appeal and accordingly could not act for him. Their advice to the applicant was in accordance with proper professional practice (see paragraph 20 below). The applicant then sought to instruct another firm of solicitors but they were also unwilling to act for him.\n\nOn 31 July 1990, notwithstanding the advice which had been given to him, the applicant lodged with the court a note of appeal setting out grounds which he formulated himself. The grounds of appeal can be summarised as follows: (a) the applicant had not been able to substantiate his contention that a crucial witness was giving false evidence against him because to do so would have involved revealing to the jury a previous conviction; (b) a number of witnesses had not been called by the Crown or by the Defence; (c) crucial evidence had been entirely fabricated; (d) the verdict of the jury was not supported by the evidence; (e) his legal advisers had disregarded instructions which he had given them and had not defended him in accordance with his instructions; (f) there had been insufficient evidence to establish that the assault had resulted in the victim\u2019s permanent disfigurement.\n\nThe applicant subsequently instructed another firm of solicitors and obtained an adjournment of the hearing of his appeal. However, shortly before the adjourned hearing, those solicitors informed the applicant that they could no longer act for him in his appeal and that they were unable to find any counsel who was willing to present the appeal. Such refusal by counsel was in accordance with the relevant rule of professional practice (see paragraph 20 below). The applicant was granted a further adjournment of the hearing of his appeal.\n\nMr Maxwell instructed yet another firm of solicitors. On 17 December 1990 they lodged an application for legal aid to pay for representation at the hearing of the appeal with the Scottish Legal Aid Board (\u201cthe Board\u201c). At the Board\u2019s request, they sought the advice of a new counsel on the prospects of success of the appeal. In an opinion dated 10 January 1991 in which he considered the grounds of appeal formulated by the applicant, counsel concluded that there was \u201cno ground of appeal against conviction and no prospects of appealing successfully against sentence\u201c. Mr Maxwell\u2019s solicitors submitted to the Board that their client should nonetheless be granted legal aid in view of the lengthy sentence which he had received.\n\nOn 25 January 1991, the Board informed Mr Maxwell that his application had been refused as the Board was not satisfied, as it was required to be under the relevant legislation (see paragraph 23 below), that there were substantial grounds for making an appeal and that it was reasonable that legal aid should be made available. His solicitors advised him that he should abandon his appeal but he chose not to accept their advice. Following the refusal of legal aid, the solicitors declined to continue to act for the applicant. A further adjournment of the hearing was then granted. The applicant decided to proceed with his appeal personally.\n\nOn 21 March 1991, the applicant addressed the High Court of Justiciary on his grounds of appeal. The Crown was represented by counsel but there is no indication that he intervened at the hearing. Presiding over the three-judge bench was the Lord Justice Clerk, one of the two most senior judges in Scotland. On the same date the court dismissed the appeal. In his judgment the Lord Justice Clerk noted that detailed grounds of appeal had been put forward and that the applicant had addressed the court at some length upon those grounds. The judgment gave full consideration to each of the grounds of appeal, but was satisfied that they had no substance and that there had been no miscarriage of justice.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 53672/00) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Ayhan \u00c7akmak and Mrs S\u00fcreyya \u00c7akmak (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 2 August 1999.\n\nThe applicants were represented by Mr O.K. Cengiz, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicants complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about the length of compensation proceedings.\n\nThe application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nBy a decision of 23 September 2003 the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nOn 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). The case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicants were born in 1952 and 1959 respectively and live in Izmir.\n\nIn 1987 the applicants' daughter, C.\u00c7., was severely injured in an accident. Her hair was burned and part of her scalp was damaged.\n\nOn 24 November 1992 C.\u00c7. underwent surgery at the Ege University Plastic Surgery Department to repair the damage to her scalp. Prior to the operation, the doctors informed the applicants about the risks involved. Following the operation, the applicants' daughter caught an infection.\n\nOn 13 January 1992 the doctors carried out a second operation on C.\u00c7. following a deterioration of her health. However, her physical appearance did not improve following the operation.\n\nOn 24 November 1993 the applicants filed an action with the Izmir Civil Court of First Instance against the doctors who performed the operation and claimed compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss sustained as a result of medical malpractice.\n\nOn 28 December 1993 the Izmir Court of First Instance issued a decision of non-jurisdiction on the ground that it was not competent to examine the acts of civil servants carried out in the exercise of their duties.\n\nOn 16 February 1994 the applicants filed an action with the Izmir Administrative Court against the Ege University Medical Department (hereinafter \u201cthe defendant\u201d) and claimed compensation for medical malpractice.\n\nOn 8 March 1994 the Izmir Administrative Court conducted a preliminary examination of the case file.\n\nOn 6 April 1994 the defendant submitted its observations to the court.\n\nOn 8 July 1994 the applicants submitted their response.\n\nOn 27 January 1995 the Izmir Administrative Court held a hearing and gave an interim decision ordering the defendant to submit all the files concerning the operation performed on the applicants' daughter.\n\nOn 20 March 1995 the defendant submitted additional observations.\n\nOn 7 April 1995 the defendant submitted thirty-seven documents concerning the operation.\n\nOn 7 November 1995 the Izmir Administrative Court appointed three experts to provide a medical opinion on C.\u00c7's operation. They were given thirty days for submission of their report.\n\nOn 23 November 1995 the experts' report was submitted to the court.\n\nOn 18 March 1996 the Izmir Administrative Court, relying on the experts' conclusions, found that there was no indication of any negligence on the part of the Medical Department in the treatment given to C.\u00c7. The court therefore dismissed the applicants' claim for compensation.\n\nOn 5 September 1996 the applicants appealed against the judgment of the first-instance court.\n\nOn 4 October 1996 the defendant submitted its observations to the Administrative Court.\n\nOn 13 November 1996 the case file was sent to the Supreme Administrative Court together with the applicant's appeal and the defendant's response thereto.\n\nOn 28 October 1998 the Supreme Administrative Court, without holding a hearing, dismissed the applicants' appeal.\n\nOn 3 February 1999 the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court was served on the applicants.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 31880/96) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr H\u0131d\u0131r Ad\u0131yaman (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 21 May 1996.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mrs Oya Ersoy Ataman, a lawyer practising in Ankara (Turkey). The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr R\u0131za T\u00fcrmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc to sit as an ad hoc judge, in his place (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1).\n\nThe President of the Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present application should be joined to other applications against the same respondent State raising the same complaints (applications nos. 26480/95, 28291/95, 29280/95, 26699/96, 29700/96, 29701/96, 29702/96, 29703/96, 29911/96, 29912/96, 29913/96, 31831/96, 31834/96, 31853/96, 31891/96, 31960/96, 32964/96, 32987/96, 32900/96, 33362/96, 33369/96, 33645/96, 34591/96, 34687/96, 39428/96 and 43362/96) (Rule 43 \u00a7 2).\n\nBy a decision of 31 August 1999, having obtained the parties\u2019 observations, the Court declared the application admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nA. Arrest and detention of the applicant\n\nOn 31 August 1981 police officers from the Ankara Security Directorate arrested the applicant on suspicion of membership of an illegal armed organisation, the Dev-Yol (Revolutionary Way).\n\nOn 19 October 1981 the Ankara Martial Law Court (s\u0131k\u0131y\u00f6netim mahkemesi) ordered the applicant\u2019s detention on remand.\n\nB. Trial in the Ankara Martial Law Court\n\nOn 26 February 1982 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Martial Law Court against the applicant and 722 other defendants. The Public Prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of the Dev-Yol, whose object was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. The prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code.\n\nOn 18 May 1987 the applicant was released pending trial.\n\nIn a judgment of 19 July 1989 the Martial Law Court convicted the applicant of membership of the Dev-Yol. It sentenced the applicant to 12 years\u2019 imprisonment under Article 146 \u00a7 3 of the Turkish Criminal Code, permanently debarred him from employment in the civil service.\n\nC. Proceedings on appeal\n\nThe applicant appealed.\n\nFollowing promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Court of Cassation (yarg\u0131tay) acquired jurisdiction over the case and on 26 December 1994 the case file was transmitted to it.\n\nOn 27 December 1995 the Court of Cassation quashed the applicant\u2019s conviction on the ground that he should have been convicted of the offence under Article 146 \u00a7 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code. It referred the case to the Ankara Assize Court (a\u011f\u0131r ceza mahkemesi). The criminal proceedings are still pending before the latter court.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 40498/98) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Murat K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 7 March 1998.\n\nThe applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr S. Kaya, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe applicant alleged that he had been denied a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal due to the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court which tried and convicted him. He maintained under Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention that he had been convicted on account of his political opinions.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1.\n\nOn 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 \u00a7 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 \u00a7 1).\n\nBy a decision of 8 July 2003, the Court declared the application partly admissible. It retained the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the alleged lack of independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court which tried and convicted him and declared inadmissible the remainder of his complaints.\n\nThe applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Ankara.\n\nOn 18 October 1992 the applicant was arrested by police officers from the Ankara Security Directorate following a search conducted in his house.\n\nOn 2 November 1992 the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security Court laid charges against the applicant and six other persons for having formed an illegal organisation (\u201cPartiye Rizgariye Kurdistan\u201d: hereinafter \u201cPRK\u201d) whose aim was to undermine the territorial integrity of the State by illegal means. The applicant and his co-accused were also charged with distributing illegal leaflets and carrying identification cards and driving licences belonging to third parties.\n\nThe public prosecutor requested the court to convict the applicant and his co-accused under Article 125 of the Criminal Code with reference to Articles 171 \u00a7 1, 350 \u00a7 2 and 536 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the same Code as well as Article 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991). The public prosecutor relied on the leaflets, the internal regulations of the PRK as well as the latter\u2019s political programme and flag, all of which were seized during the search of the applicant\u2019s and his co-accused\u2019s houses.\n\nOn 7 November 1996 the Ankara State Security Court found the applicant and four of his co-accused guilty of an offence under Article 168 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code and Article 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The search of their houses had uncovered the internal regulations of the party whose aim was to establish an independent Kurdish State on the territory of the Turkish State through dissemination of propaganda. The court also noted that the aim of the party was to set up by means of force an independent socialist and united State of Kurdistan within the territories of Iran, Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe court sentenced the applicant and four of his co-accused to twelve years and six months\u2019 imprisonment and debarred them from public service indefinitely. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 7 October 1997 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 33274/96) against the United Kingdom lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a British national, Mr Gordon Foxley (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 14 November 1995.\n\nThe applicant, who was granted legal aid, was represented by Mr Phillip Leach, a lawyer practising in London. The Government of the United Kingdom (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr Martin Eaton, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London.\n\nThe applicant alleged, in particular, that the decision of the authorities of the respondent State to open, read and copy to file his correspondence was an unjustified interference with his right guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention.\n\nThe application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\nThe application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court.\n\nBy a decision of 12 October 1999, the Chamber declared the application partly admissible.\n\nThe applicant and the Government were each invited to file observations on the merits (Rule 59 \u00a7 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 \u00a7 2 in fine). The parties made submissions on the applicant\u2019s claims under Article 41 of the Convention.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nOn 3 April 1989 the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (\u201cthe 1988 Act\u201d) entered into force. Under the 1988 Act, trial courts were empowered to make confiscation orders aimed at removing assessed benefits obtained through the commission of offences of which a person has been found guilty.\n\nOn 25 June 1992 the applicant was arrested and subsequently charged and committed for trial.\n\nOn 3 November 1993 the Snaresbrook Crown Court convicted the applicant of twelve counts of corruption committed between 11 December 1979 and 7 August 1984, when he was employed by the Ministry of Defence as an ammunition procurement officer. The court sentenced him to four years\u2019 imprisonment under section 1 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 on each of the twelve counts, to be served concurrently.\n\nThe court conducted an enquiry under the 1988 Act and found that the applicant had benefited from the commission of the offences in the amount of GBP 2,092,569.20. Pursuant to section 71 of the 1988 Act, a confiscation Order was made against him in the amount of GPB 1,503,301.80, the amount at which his realisable assets was assessed. This sum was to be paid within eighteen months. In default of payment the applicant was to be imprisoned for a further (consecutive) term of three years.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s appeals against his conviction and sentence, as well as in relation to the amount and basis of calculation of the confiscation Order, were dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 6 February 1995. The applicant did not dispute before the Court of Appeal that he had realisable assets in excess of GBP 1.27 million.\n\nOn 4 December 1995 the Bow Street Magistrates\u2019 Court issued a summons for the commitment of the applicant to custody for default in the payment of the amount due under the confiscation Order. The hearing on whether the applicant should be committed to custody for non-payment of the confiscation Order was adjourned at the request of the Crown Prosecution Service (\u201cCPS\u201d) pending an investigation into alternative methods of recovery.\n\nOn 8 August 1996, in connection with the enforcement of the confiscation Order, Ms S.D. was appointed as Receiver to realise the applicant\u2019s property, including any property of the applicant held by third parties. The High Court, which appointed the Receiver under section 80(2) of the 1988 Act on application by the CPS and after the applicant had been given a further opportunity to comply with the confiscation Order, ordered that the Receiver\u2019s powers were not to be exercised until the interests of the restrained properties had been determined.\n\nOn 2 September 1996, following an application on behalf of the Ministry of Defence in separate civil proceedings, the applicant was declared bankrupt. Ms S.D. was appointed as the applicant\u2019s Trustee in Bankruptcy. This appointment was independent of her appointment as Receiver.\n\nFollowing an ex parte application by the Receiver and Trustee in Bankruptcy, Ms S.D., the District Judge at Reading County Court ordered, on 27 September 1996, that: \u201cfor a period of three months from the 27th day of September 1996 all postal packets (as defined by section 83 of the Post Office Act 1953) directed or addressed to the Bankrupt ... shall be re-directed, sent or delivered by the Post Office to [the Trustee in Bankruptcy\u2019s address].\u201d\n\nThe Order was made under section 371 of the Insolvency Act 1986 in favour of Ms S.D. in her capacity as the applicant\u2019s Trustee in Bankruptcy. The application was based on the grounds that the Trustee in Bankruptcy was of the opinion that communications concerning remittances and useful information in respect of the applicant\u2019s assets and liabilities which would better enable her to perform her duties might be forwarded to the applicant\u2019s address and lost to the applicant\u2019s estate if the Order were not made. The grounds invoked were supported by an affidavit sworn on 27 September 1996, which affirmed that it was necessary for postal packets to be intercepted immediately and without notice to the applicant to enable the Trustee in Bankruptcy properly to identify the applicant\u2019s assets and sources of income.\n\nAn exception was made in the Order of 27 September 1996 for letters on which there was a specific direction, signed by the Trustee in Bankruptcy, that any such letter was to be delivered as addressed, if possible.\n\nBetween 27 September 1996 and 10 January 1997, a total of 71 letters addressed to the applicant were re-directed to the Receiver and Trustee in Bankruptcy. These letters included, inter alia, a letter from the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence Police, two letters from the Legal Aid Board concerning civil proceedings to which the applicant was a party, a letter from the Police Complaints Authority, two letters from his legal advisers, the Legal Department of the National Council for Civil Liberties (later referred to as \u201cLiberty\u201d) relating to the proceedings before the European Commission of Human Rights, and affidavits and drafts made or prepared for use in the High Court in relation to the receivership proceedings.\n\nEach of the letters mentioned above was copied to file before being forwarded promptly to the applicant.\n\nIn his letter of 28 November 1996 to the Receiver and Trustee in Bankruptcy the applicant expressed particular concern that apparently privileged material was being intercepted. On 2 December 1996 the Receiver and Trustee replied that no mail from the Police, Legal Aid, the National Council for Civil Liberties and the European Court of Human Rights would be opened in the future, as long as the sender\u2019s names were clearly stamped on the envelopes.\n\nAlthough the re-direction Order expired on 27 December 1996 it was only as from 18 January 1997 that the applicant began to receive his mail directly again. During that period there were two mail deliveries to the Trustee in Bankruptcy. One delivery was received on 30 December 1996, the other on 10 January 1997. The deliveries contained ten items of mail, none of which fell within the categories described above (see paragraph 19). A number of the items were however copied to file before being forwarded to the applicant.\n\nOn 25 February 1997 the applicant issued a summons for a stay of the receivership proceedings pending the determination of his application to the Commission. The hearing was listed for 16 June 1997 but was adjourned to 19 February 1998. On that date the High Court dismissed the application and confirmed that the receivership proceedings should continue. The applicant has not informed the Court of any subsequent developments in the receivership proceedings.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 29840/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Hasan Erkan, on 15 August 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented before the Court by Ms Arzu Becerik, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not appoint an agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 24 March 2005 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1927 and lives in Yalova. He worked as a teacher and retired on 3 September 1973. On 31 October 1991 he completed a pre-undergraduate (\u00f6nlisans) course at Anadolu University.\n\nOn 19 February 1992 the applicant applied to the Directorate of Education in Istanbul (Milli E\u011fitim M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc) and requested to be reassigned to a post as a teacher. Since he had obtained a higher education diploma, he expected to be promoted to a higher grade for each year of work as a teacher, in accordance with Article 36 of the Law on Civil Servants (Law No. 657). This, in turn, would entitle him to a higher pension.\n\nOn 5 May 1992 the Ministry of Education appointed the applicant to the post of primary school teacher in Kartal district of Istanbul. This decision was sent to the Kartal District Governor (Kaymakaml\u0131k) on 26 May 1992 but not communicated to the applicant.\n\nOn 7 August 1992 the applicant once again applied to the Istanbul Directorate of Education and found out about the decision of 5 May 1992. On 10 August 1992 he started working as a teacher.\n\nOn 1 October 1992 the applicant's contract was terminated by the Ministry of Education on the ground that when he started to work he was over the age of 65, i.e. the compulsory retirement age in Turkey. Furthermore, the days he worked from 10 August 1992 until 1 October 1992 were not added to the total period of his service. As a result, the applicant could not advance to a higher grade.\n\nOn 17 January 1993 the applicant filed an action before the Ankara Administrative Court and asked for the days he worked in 1992 to be taken into account when calculating the total period of his service. He also stated that the reason for him to start working after he was over the age of sixty-five had been the failure of the authorities to communicate him the decision concerning his assignment.\n\nOn 22 December 1994 the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed his request. The applicant appealed on 5 May 1995 but did not pay the necessary appeal fees until 3 August 1995.\n\nOn 27 April 1998 the Council of State quashed the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court. In the opinion of the Council of State, the applicant should have been considered as a civil servant on the day of the appointment and not on the day of his actually taking up his duties.\n\nOn 7 October 1999 the Administrative Court rendered its decision in which it insisted in its decision of 22 December 1994. The Administrative Court considered that the applicant could only be considered as a civil servant on the day he actually started to work, and not on the day of his appointment. It further stated that awarding the statutory rights (\u00f6zl\u00fck haklar\u0131) to civil servants before they begin their service had no legal basis in domestic law. In the light of the aforementioned considerations, the court ruled that the applicant did not have the right to advance to a higher grade. The applicant appealed against this decision on 19 January 2000 but did not pay the necessary court fees until 23 May 2000.\n\nOn 15 November 2002 the Joint Council of the Council of State's Administrative Chambers (Dan\u0131\u015ftay \u0130dari Dava Daireleri Genel Kurulu) upheld the first-instance court's judgment. This decision was served on the applicant on 17 February 2003.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 68446/01) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr G\u00fcrcan Keman (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 13 November 2000.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr S. \u00d6zay, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 26 April 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Manisa, Turkey.\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\nIn 1991 the applicant sat a competition for admission to the civil service. Following his success in the competition, the General Directorate of Higher Education Credit and Hostels Institution (\u201cthe General Directorate\u201d) (T.C. Y\u00fcksek \u00d6\u011frenim ve Yurtlar Kurumu Genel M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc) conducted a pre-employment background investigation. It found that the applicant had not mentioned his criminal record in his application form.\n\nOn 14 January 1992 the General Directorate decided that the applicant was not eligible for appointment to a vacant post on account of the negative findings in the pre\u2011employment investigation. In particular, in 1980 the applicant had been convicted of issuing threats against one of his teachers and had been sentenced to four months and twenty days' imprisonment, which had then been converted into a fine.\n\n1. First set of proceedings\n\nOn 7 February 1992 the applicant brought an action in the Ankara Administrative Court requesting the annulment of the General Directorate's decision of 14 January 1992.\n\nOn 26 October 1993 the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed the action. The applicant appealed.\n\nOn 18 December 1995 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the Ankara Administrative Court's judgment holding that the applicant was suitable for employment.\n\nOn 22 December 1998 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the General Directorate's request for rectification of its decision.\n\nOn 10 March 1999 the Ankara Administrative Court abided by the Supreme Administrative Court's decision. It found that the applicant had fulfilled all the requirements of the vacant post in question as prescribed under Law no. 657. It therefore ruled that the applicant was eligible to become a civil servant.\n\nOn 8 June 1999 the General Directorate appealed.\n\nOn 31 October 2001 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the appeal.\n\nOn 30 May 2002 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the request for rectification of the decision.\n\n2. Second set of proceedings\n\nOn an unspecified date, the applicant brought a new action in the Ankara Administrative Court against the General Directorate requesting compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage which he allegedly had suffered as a result of the decision dated 14 January 1992.\n\nOn 28 December 1999 the Ankara Administrative Court awarded the applicant a certain amount of compensation for pecuniary damage but rejected his request for non-pecuniary damage. The court further decided that legal costs should be shared by the parties, given that it partially acceded to the applicant's claims for compensation.\n\nOn 26 April 2000 the General Directorate appealed the Supreme Administrative Court judgment, arguing that the applicant had not suffered any damage and that therefore the legal costs should be borne by him.\n\nOn 30 May 2002 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the appeal, holding that the Ankara Administrative Court's ruling was in conformity with law and procedure.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 22922/03) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Halil Kaya (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 4 February 2003.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr K. Derin, a lawyer practising in Adana. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent.\n\nOn 28 September 2006 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaint concerning the lack of legal assistance to the applicant during his police custody. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 \u00a7 3).\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nThe applicant was born in 1983 and lives in Adana.\n\nOn 31 December 2000 at about 00.15 a.m. the applicant, who was seventeen years old at the time, was taken into police custody in Adana on suspicion of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation by way of chanting slogans in favour of that organisation and by burning tyres in the streets. The same day he was interrogated by the police and the public prosecutor respectively, in the absence of a lawyer. According to the information in the file, the applicant was released on the second day of custody.\n\nOn 10 January 2001 the Public Prosecutor at the Adana State Security Court filed an indictment accusing the applicant and three others of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, an offence under Article 169 of the Criminal Code and Section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713).\n\nBetween 10 January and 13 August 2001, the court held thirty-four hearings, during which the applicant was not represented by a lawyer. A lawyer was assigned to the applicant for the hearing of 3 September 2001.\n\nOn 3 December 2001 the State Security Court delivered its judgment. It convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to two years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. In convicting the applicant, the court had regard to the applicant\u2019s statements to the police and the public prosecutor, which were taken in the absence of a lawyer. On 8 July 2002 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, without holding a hearing on the merits. The decision dated 8 July 2002 was deposited with the registry of the Adana State Security Court on 21 August 2002. Subsequently, on 11 September 2002 the applicant was sent to prison to serve his sentence.\n\nIn the meantime, on 30 July 2003 Law no. 4963 entered into force, which amended Article 169 of the Criminal Code. Relying on the fact that the new law provided more favourable provisions for the applicant, on 29 August 2003 the applicant\u2019s lawyer requested the re-opening of the proceedings. On 15 September 2003 the Adana Criminal Court decided to re-open the case and ordered the applicant\u2019s release from prison. The matter was accordingly re-examined by the Adana Criminal Code and, in view of the new wording of Article 169 of the Criminal Code, on 7 October 2004 the court held that the applicant should not be convicted under Article 169 but under Article 312. As a result, he was sentenced to three months and ten days\u2019 imprisonment and his sentence was converted to a fine. Furthermore, in accordance with Law no. 647, the execution of his sentence was postponed. On 7 October 2004 the applicant appealed.\n\nOn 19 December 2005 the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation decided that the case file should be remitted to the Adana Criminal Court for re-examination. In his decision, the prosecutor referred to new legislation which had entered into force on 12 October 2004, amending the Criminal Code once again. The Prosecutor drew further attention to another new amendment which had been made on 31 March 2005 to Law no. 5326 concerning misdemeanours.\n\nThe applicant\u2019s case was once again examined by the Adana Criminal Court in view of the recent legislative amendments. Finally, on 8 May 2006 the court found the applicant guilty under Article 215 of Law no. 5326 and sentenced him to twenty five days\u2019 imprisonment. The court further converted the sentence to a fine and, pursuant to Law no. 5395 on Juvenile Protection, it decided to defer adjudication of the sentence. This decision was upheld by the Adana Assize Court on 20 June 2007.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 48083/99) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr M\u00fckremin K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7 (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 27 March 1999.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr H. K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcksoy, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 27 April 2004 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal and the failure to notify him of the public prosecutor\u2019s submissions on his appeal to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant, who was born in 1959, lives in Ankara.\n\nThe applicant was the Deputy Mayor of the Sincan District in Ankara at the time of the events. In his capacity as the deputy mayor, he was responsible for the activities of the Culture and Education Department of the Sincan District Council. In January 1997, the Culture and Education Department prepared a thirty-day programme for the month of Ramadan. The draft programme was submitted to the applicant for his approval. After consulting the mayor, the applicant authorised the organising committee to begin the necessary preparations.\n\nOne of the events foreseen for 31 January 1997 was called the \u201cJerusalem Night\u201d. This event was announced months in advance and representatives of several embassies as well as several important personalities living in the district were invited. The hall was decorated with posters of martyrs who had given their lives for the liberation of Jerusalem. A five-minute play was also written for the evening. The play took the form of a conversation between a father and his son about life in Palestine and the struggle of the Palestinian people. The mayor of Sincan and the Ambassador to Iran made speeches before the play began.\n\nOn 6 February 1997 the applicant was taken into police custody. He was accused of having disseminated propaganda in support of an armed, illegal organisation, namely the Hezbollah.\n\nIn his statement at the police station, the applicant denied being involved in any illegal organisation.\n\nOn 13 February 1997 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor. During his questioning, he repeated the statements he had made at the police station.\n\nOn the same day the applicant was brought before the investigating judge attached to the Ankara State Security Court and was remanded in custody.\n\nIn an indictment dated 7 March 1997, the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara State Security Court initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant. It was alleged that he had disseminated propaganda in support of an armed, illegal organisation. The prosecution therefore called for the applicant to be sentenced pursuant to Article 169 of the Turkish Criminal Code and Article 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.\n\nOn 15 October 1997 the Ankara State Security Court, which was composed of three judges including a military judge, concluded that the applicant had aided and abetted a terrorist organisation by engaging in propaganda in support thereof. It found the applicant guilty as charged, sentenced him to three years and nine months\u2019 imprisonment and debarred him from public service for three years.\n\nThe applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation. The Chief Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation submitted his written opinion on the merits of the appeal. The opinion was not notified to the applicant, but was read out during the hearing before the Court of Cassation.\n\nOn 21 September 1998 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, upholding the Ankara State Security Court\u2019s assessment of the evidence and its reasons for rejecting the applicant\u2019s defence.\n\nOn 7 December 1998 the chief public prosecutor attached to the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant\u2019s request for rectification.",

    "PROCEDURE\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 56497/00) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by a Turkish national, Mr Osman \u00d6z\u00e7elik (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 19 January 2000.\n\nThe applicant was represented by Mr M.N. \u00d6zmen, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\n\nOn 2 September 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Ankara. He was the deputy chairman of the pro-Kurdish HADEP (Halk\u0131n Demokrasi Partisi \u2013 People\u2019s Democracy Party) prior to the events giving rise to the present application.\n\nOn 21 July 1999 the applicant was taken into custody by police officers from the anti-terror branch of the Ankara Security Directorate. According to the arrest protocol (yakalama tutana\u011f\u0131) signed by four police officers and the applicant, a search warrant had been issued in respect of the applicant. When the officers saw the applicant, they asked him to show his identity card. The applicant however attempted to escape.\n\nOn 23 July 1999 the deputy director of the Ankara Security Directorate sent a letter to the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court requesting that the applicant\u2019s custody period be extended. The deputy director maintained, inter alia, that the applicant had been taken into custody on 21 July 1999 during the course of a police operation carried out against the PKK and that the police had not yet completed the detailed questioning of the applicant and the gathering of evidence.\n\nThe public prosecutor referred the security directorate\u2019s request to the Ankara State Security Court. On the same day, the single judge of the State Security Court decided to extend the custody period for three days starting from 24 July 1999, including 26 July 1999. The applicant did not appear before the judge.\n\nOn 25 July 1999 two police officers from the anti-terror branch of the Ankara Security Directorate took statements from the applicant. The applicant was questioned, in particular, about his statements made in several television programmes, broadcast on MED-TV, a pro-Kurdish channel, in which he had taken part in his capacity as deputy chairman of the HADEP.\n\nOn 27 July 1999 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court, who questioned him about his statements during the same television programmes. Subsequently, the public prosecutor requested the Ankara State Security Court to order the applicant\u2019s detention on remand.\n\nOn the same day, the single judge at the Ankara State Security Court ordered the applicant\u2019s release from detention, having regard to the nature of the alleged offence and the state of the evidence.\n\nOn 9 August 1999 the public prosecutor requested that the Ankara State Security Court file a bill of indictment, charging the applicant with aiding and abetting members of the PKK on account of his statements made during the television programmes shown on MED-TV.\n\nOn 21 December 2000 new legislation (Law no. 4616) on the suspension of proceedings and the execution of sentences regarding offences committed before 23 April 1999 came into force.\n\nOn 25 June 2002 the Ankara State Security Court decided to defer the imposition of a final sentence on the applicant, pursuant to Law no. 4616. The court held, under Article 1 \u00a7 4 of the same law, that the criminal proceedings against him would be suspended and a final sentence would be imposed should he be convicted of a similar offence within five years of this decision.",

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\nThe applicants were born in 1948, 1974, 1965, 1964 and 1963 respectively. They were employed by the construction company LK M\u00e4ssinteri\u00f6r AB (hereinafter \u201cthe company\u201d) between 3 March and 30 July 1999 on a time-wage basis.\n\nThe company, being a member of the Industries, was bound by a collective labour agreement, the Construction Agreement (Byggnads-avtalet), concluded between the Swedish Building Workers\u2019 Union (Svenska Byggnadsarbetaref\u00f6rbundet, hereinafter \u201cthe Union\u201d) and the Industries. The relevant local branch of the Union in the instant case was the Stockholm branch, Byggettan.\n\nAt the material time, eight employees in the company carried out work covered by the labour agreement. Three of these workers were members of the Union whereas the five applicants were not members of the Union or of any other trade union.\n\nUnder section 3, subsection f 5 of the collective agreement, as it stood at the relevant time, the local branch had the right to inspect on a continuous basis wage conditions by measuring piecework (ackordsarbete) and result work (resultatarbete), as well as monitoring time-based work (tidl\u00f6nearbete). If inspections were carried out in accordance with the collective agreement, the local branch had the right to reimbursement of the costs involved on the basis of a fee of 1.5% of the worker\u2019s wages. The employer was obliged to deduct this amount from the worker\u2019s wages and to supply the local branch with the information necessary for the inspection work.\n\nOn 12 January 1978 the Industries and the Union concluded an accord pursuant to which a worker organised in a trade union other than the Union could request his or her employer not to deduct the inspection fee, with the result that the Union would no longer have the right to request either information or the payment of a fee in respect of that worker. In a subsequent dispute between the Industries and the Union over the interpretation of the accord, an out-of-court settlement was reached on 29 February 2000 to the effect that it applied to all workers belonging to a trade union other than the Union.\n\nOn 22 May 1991 the company and Byggettan concluded an agreement concerning the inspection work. The agreement gave details of the work and specified, inter alia, that it was the company\u2019s responsibility to provide Byggettan with the wage information and to deduct fees from the wages of the workers and pay them to Byggettan six times a year. The information was to include the place of work, the names and social security numbers of the workers and the working hours and net wages.\n\nThe applicants requested to be exempt from the deductions, which in their case concerned fees for monitoring the wages for hourly work. The company complied with their requests, stopped paying the fees to Byggettan and did not provide it with the above-mentioned wage information concerning the applicants. Byggettan insisted on payment and initiated formal local negotiations. These were held on 23 March and 19 April 1999. However, no solution was reached, either in the local negotiations or in the subsequent central negotiations between the Industries and the Union.\n\nThe Industries eventually brought the case before the Labour Court (Arbetsdomstolen), seeking a declaratory judgment to the effect that the company was not obliged to levy the monitoring fees in question. It argued that the inspection of wages, in so far as it did not concern the technical measuring of piecework, aimed at securing the observance of the provisions of the collective labour agreement and was therefore part of the general activities of the Union. Moreover, the 1998 and 1999 annual reports of Byggettan allegedly showed that the inspection fees greatly exceeded the costs of the work and that the surplus was used for general union activities. Consequently, the corresponding deductions from the applicants\u2019 wages were tantamount to forced union membership or, at least, involved an unacceptable compulsion to join the Union or another trade union. The conduct thus violated their negative freedom of association under Article 11 of the Convention as well as under domestic law. Furthermore, since the applicants did not share the political values of the Union, the levy on their wages also violated their rights under Article 10 of the Convention.\n\nTwo of the applicants, Mr Evaldsson and Mr Hodell, were heard by the Labour Court. They submitted that they opposed the deductions because they did not think that the monitoring work was of any use to them and considered the deductions an unnecessary expense. Allegedly, they also submitted that they felt that the deductions were unjust.\n\nThe Union disagreed with the Industries, arguing that the monitoring fees could not be seen as tantamount to forced membership of the Union, such membership being secured through the payment of a separate membership fee. The system of monitoring fees did not involve a compulsion to join a trade union. Moreover, the applicants had not expressed any ideological reasons for their unwillingness to contribute to the monitoring work. The Union claimed that, contrary to the Industries\u2019 allegation, the 1998 and 1999 annual reports of Byggettan showed that the proceeds of that work had not contributed to general union activities but that, in fact, the monitoring had been run at a loss. Furthermore, the inspection work was strictly separated, economically and otherwise, from the other activities of Byggettan. Finally, arguing that the positive aspect of the freedom of association under Article 11 of the Convention was stronger than its negative counterpart, the Union claimed that a ban on the levying of monitoring fees on unorganised workers\u2019 wages would violate the positive rights of its members, as this could induce members to leave the Union in order to avoid paying the fees.\n\nBy a judgment of 7 March 2001, the Labour Court rejected the Industries\u2019 claims. It referred to several of its previous judgments concerning various types of measurement and monitoring fees. In a case from 1977 (AD 1977 nr 222), the court had found that the monitoring of time-based wages was wholly different from the measuring of piecework, as no special action had to be taken to establish the amount and type of work performed. Instead, the inspection of time-based wages rather aimed at securing the observance of the collective labour agreement and also served as a basis for the statistics used by the Union in wage negotiations with the employers. Consequently, the monitoring benefited the general union activities and the fees contributed financially to those activities. The court had therefore concluded that the levying of fees on the wages of members of the Syndicalist Union for monitoring work carried out by another trade union involved a violation of those worker\u2019s positive freedom of association, as they would have to resign from their own organisation in order to avoid contributing to both organisations. The Labour Court stated that there was no reason to come to a different conclusion in the instant case as to the nature of the monitoring work. Thus, from the point of view of association law, there was no reason to distinguish between monitoring work and general union activities. Having reached that conclusion, the court found no reason to determine whether the monitoring fees generated a surplus which contributed to other union activities. However, the situation in the instant case was different from the 1977 case in that the applicants were not subjected to pressure to leave their organisation. Instead, the question was to what extent they were protected by a right to negative freedom of association. The Labour Court noted that the negative freedom of association under domestic law was exclusively based on the Convention. It referred to the European Court\u2019s case-law and drew the conclusion that only the core of the negative freedom of association was protected under Article 11 of the Convention, meaning that a person must have been subjected to a certain measure of force or at least strong pressure to join an organisation in order to give rise to a violation of Article 11. The Labour Court initially concluded that the monitoring fee deductions did not entail membership of the Union and that no pressure had been exerted to compel the applicants to join the Union against their will. It further found that the fact that the applicants, through payment of the monitoring fee, indirectly supported the activities of the Union did not in itself amount to forced membership, since being a member of the Union also entailed certain other duties, such as loyalty to its objectives and payment of a membership fee. The situation would have been different if the applicants would to some extent have been associated with the Union\u2019s ideology as a result of the monitoring fee deductions. However, the fee in issue was deducted in accordance with their employer\u2019s obligations under the collective labour agreement, and it was, accordingly, difficult to see a link with the Union\u2019s ideology. In this connection, the court also referred to the evidence given before it by Mr Evaldsson and Mr Hodell. While it questioned whether the grounds for their position in the case could have a bearing on their negative freedom of association, the court nevertheless found that there was no indication that they opposed the deduction of the fees because they took exception to union activities in general or to the ideology of the Union. The Labour Court went on to state that, while the applicants, through the fee deductions, contributed to the general activities of the Union, they were not treated any differently from Union members as concerns the monitoring. In order to monitor the observance of the collective labour agreement, the work was carried out with respect to all employees affected by the agreement, whether belonging to a trade union or not. Noting that it could appear offensive to an unorganised worker to have to contribute to the work, the court stated that it was not without importance that the unorganised worker in fact obtained something in return for the fee paid. The Labour Court further noted that, theoretically, the applicants could be inclined to join a trade union other than the Union in order to avoid the wage deduction for the monitoring fee. It found, however, that it was not very realistic that an employee would regard the wage deduction as a particular incentive to do so. The Labour Court concluded that all the above considerations indicated that the deductions did not breach the applicants\u2019 rights under the Convention. As to the main issue to be determined \u2013 whether the monitoring fee was intended as a measure to pressure them to join the Union \u2013 the court could not find that it had any such coercive effect. As the fee was not tantamount to forced membership of the Union and had not influenced or forced the applicants to join the Union, the company had been obliged to make a deduction from their wages in accordance with the collective labour agreement.",
